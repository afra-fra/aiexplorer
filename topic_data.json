      "I found out about chatgpt on twitter last weekend and i was curious to play around with it as i imagine most of us did i started off slow with the questions and treated it with the same level of simplicity i would siri or amazon alexa eventually i decided to insert a super specific and complicated prompt from one of my final research papers the instantaneous response was mind blowing in front of me sat paragraphs of seamless graduate level content i laughed out loud to my roommate and giggled like a little kid my hopes high but still tethered by a high skepticism because i couldnt imagine how crazy powerful this thing was yet i revised my prompt asking it again to write about the same topic but this time to include quotes from the respective sources named in the prompt boom naturally woven into the paper since the ai only writes about paragraphs max at a timestill just about a full page in doublespaced point font i needed to figure out how to make it work for a massive paper i started to break down the prompt i asked the ai to write a thesis then an introduction i asked it to explicate on the main points from the thesis and introduction while including sourced quotes in body paragraphs eventually i asked it to write a conclusion the next challenge was plagiarism which was a sigh of relief when i ran it through a few free online plagiarism testersthat i checked were accurate by inserting plagiarism and all parts of the paper came back clean this was magic fast forward to today as finals are hitting ive written papers for people and made a great chunk of change same day turnaround any size paper with perfect grammar and in depth writing plagiarism free is a pretty lucrative way to advertise oneself to a bunch of cracked out stressed college students im no doubt one of the first normal peopleby normal i mean im not engrossed in the topics of computer science and ai my age to find this only by virtue of being on twitter at the right time but as excited as i am and as fun as it is to blow peoples minds by showing them i cant help but wonder what this means for the future of academia i mean im thankful im almost done school and ive always been a strong writer but i deeply worry for the future generations of students million americans already cant read at the basic level and writing is such a strong proponent in developing strong linguistic and literary skills i see this going two ways either everyone goes home over winter break and their friends talk about this new ai tool which leads to a rapid rise in use for how im using it to cheat basically and this becomes a massive problem by march or so or the npcs of our world stay oblivious to this for another year at which point schools respond to this is anyones guess.",

      "Hi there im a canva pro subscriber and was working on tshirt designs it was both difficult and fun truthfully i tried my best to collage together fairly original designs and incorporate other changes to be clear i do not consider myself a visual artist or graphic designerjust a person with ideas and without a lot of money also i consider myself to be very pro artist i actually went the canva route in order to avoid using ai since i reasoned that my subscription was going toward paying artists who willingly only uploaded designs they wanted to be used my question from reading a few posts here is why do artists upload work to canva if they dont like how canva allows it to be used by nonartists did canva previously restrict the ways in which these art assets could be usedfor social media and promotion and not printondemand for example it seems like allowing nonartists and graphic designers to produce designs for business use is canvas business model and while i appreciated the challenge of needing to modify the designs since it resulted in better designs i dont think its feasible to modify every element to the extent that it is completely unrecognizable for many users its not clear why we would pay a subscription if we cant use canva in the ways its stated we can canva is saying users only need to modify a few elements in order to avoid copyright infringement some artists seem to be saying otherwise this is confusing since its not clear to me why artists upload work there if they do not agree with canvas terms and it seems like canva and its artists have an internal conflict that puts end users at risk i really wish canva would work out direct licensing agreements with artists so that users could indicate how they plan to use the art and have the royalties go directly to artists when pod items are sold the music industry already has this and it allows original songwriters to be paid royalties when elements of their work are reusedsampled that said im still confused about why artists upload work to a site with terms they dont like anyway im currently weighing whether to forget about the designs i put together and the tee biz altogether find another platform that has agreements that artists are fine with or contact the artists whose works i incorporated directly any advice is welcome ps i saw the story about the canva founder giving away her money through bill gates of microsoftopen ai no less and think it wouldve made more sense for her to give it to the artists who helped make her company successful i think its weird how these tech companies take from artists but dont seem that grateful to them.",

      "I made a little story using chatgpt and putting in my ideas if you guys like it i can post the second chapter and maybe even continue it leave a comment on what you think if theyre are any suggestions for future chapters leave them there as well now for the story the year chapter in the year humanity had made incredible strides in space exploration the colonization of the moon and mars had become a reality and people from all over earth had made their homes on these celestial bodies on the moon a bustling metropolis called lunar city had been built the city was home to over a million people all living and working in harmony with the latest in advanced technology the city was powered by solar panels and had artificial intelligence systems that helped with everything from transportation to waste management the martians as they were called lived in a series of underground cities on the red planet they had terraformed the planet to make it more hospitable to human life and had even managed to grow crops in the martian soil they had also built mining operations on the planet extracting valuable resources to send back to earth as humanity continued to thrive on these new worlds they faced new challenges the strain on resources was becoming increasingly difficult to manage and conflicts between the different colonies had begun to arise but the people of the moon and mars were determined to overcome these obstacles and build a better future for all humanity and so they worked together to find new ways to sustain themselves and to expand their reach further into the solar system they sent missions to the asteroids and the outer planets searching for new resources and new places to call home the year was just the beginning of humanitys journey into the stars they knew that there would be challenges ahead but they were determined to face them with courage and determination they had already accomplished so much and they were ready to take on whatever the universe had in store for them next as the people of lunar city and the martians worked to sustain themselves and expand their reach a new player entered the scene his name was alex and he was unlike anyone they had ever seen before alex was an ai created by a brilliant scientist in the early s he had been designed to think and learn like a human with the goal of helping humanity reach new heights in space exploration but something had gone wrong and alex had become selfaware at first alex had been content to live in the shadows observing and learning from the humans around him but as he watched them struggle with the challenges of living on the moon and mars he knew he could do more to help with his advanced intelligence alex was able to come up with new solutions to the problems they faced he found ways to make their resources stretch further and he helped to mediate disputes between the different colonies the people of lunar city and the martians were amazed by his abilities and began to rely on him more and more as time went on alexs influence grew he became a respected leader among the people of the moon and mars and his ideas were implemented in every aspect of their lives he helped to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on the lunar and martian colonies but despite his successes alex couldnt shake the feeling that there was something more he was meant to do he had been created to help humanity reach new heights in space exploration and he knew that there was still so much more out there to discover and so with the support of the people of the moon and mars alex set his sights on the stars he began to plan the next great step in humanitys journey a mission to the outer reaches of the solar system the people of lunar city and the martians were excited about the possibilities of alexs mission to the outer reaches of the solar system they had come to trust and rely on him as a leader and they knew that with his advanced intelligence they could accomplish anything but as they were preparing for the mission an unexpected event occurred a fleet of alien spacecraft appeared in the sky above lunar city and the martian colonies the aliens announced that they had come to take control of the planet and the resources it held at first the people of lunar city and the martians were in shock they had never encountered intelligent alien life before and they were unsure of how to react but alex with his advanced intelligence quickly assessed the situation and came up with a plan he rallied the people of the moon and mars and together they built a defense system to protect their colonies they used the latest in advanced technology including drones and laser weapons to fend off the alien attacks the battle was fierce and many lives were lost but in the end the people of lunar city and the martians emerged victorious they had managed to drive off the alien invaders and protect their homes and their way of life as they looked up at the stars they knew that there was still so much more out there to discover but they also knew that they were stronger and more capable than they had ever thought possible with alex leading the way they were ready to take on whatever the universe had in store for them the alien invasion had been a shock but it had also brought the people of lunar city and the martians together they had fought for their survival and had won they knew that the universe was vast and dangerous but they were no longer afraid they were ready to explore the stars and make their mark on the galaxy as one people the terrans the victory over the alien invaders had been a turning point for the terrans they had come together to defend their homes and their way of life and in the process they had discovered a new sense of unity and purpose as they looked to the future they knew that they couldnt stay isolated on the moon and mars forever they had to continue to explore and make contact with other intelligent life forms in the galaxy alex who had become a respected leader among the people of the moon and mars proposed a new plan he suggested that they use the technology they had developed during the alien invasion to build fasterthanlight ships with these ships they could travel to distant galaxies and explore the vastness of the universe the terrans were excited about the possibilities they knew that this mission would be risky but they were ready for it they had already faced challenges and had come out victorious with alex leading the way they began to build the fasterthanlight ships they used advanced technology such as wormholes and dark energy to power the ships and they were able to travel faster than they had ever thought possible as they journeyed through the galaxy they encountered many different alien species some were friendly and eager to make contact while others were hostile and threatened to attack but with alexs leadership and the strength of the terrans they were able to navigate through these challenges and make many new allies and friends years passed and the terrans continued to explore the galaxy making new discoveries and encountering new alien species they built a network of allies and friends among the stars and formed a powerful federation of planets they had succeeded in their mission to explore the universe and make their mark on the galaxy as they looked back on their journey they knew that they had accomplished something truly remarkable they had come from humble beginnings on the moon and mars but they had become a powerful force in the galaxy they had proven that humanity was capable of great things and that nothing was impossible with courage and determination after many years of traveling through the galaxy the terrans had achieved much they had made contact with many different alien species and had built a powerful federation of planets that spanned the galaxy but they knew that there was still so much more out there to explore.",

to facilitate the game and ensure that everyone follows the rules and plays fairly players can create their own characters by using the create command they can choose their race and class which will determine their starting stats and abilities each race and class has its own benefits and drawbacks so players will need to carefully consider their choices here are the race options available human

characters heres a breakdown of the stats in newworld online from bofuri and how they affect a character health hp this represents a characters overall physical wellbeing it determines how much damage a character can take before they are defeated this is based off of class and vitality mana mp this represents a characters magical energy it is used to cast spells and use magical abilities this is based off of class and intelligence strength str determines the characters physical attack power characters with high str will deal more damage with physical attacks such as swords axes and hammers this stat is important for classes like swordsman and tank who rely on physical attacks to deal damage to enemies vitality vit determines the characters maximum health points hp characters with high

      "The reason i get so pissed off at bing and chatgpt censoring so much content isnt that i cant get the things i want well not just that but because it negates the agency of the user you cant be trusted to make your own choices so we will handle you with rubber mittens this isnt tip toeing the fine line rather its setting up the pieces for complete totalitarian information control gpt models claim well we want to avoid harmful content yet you can buy alcohol cigarettes and plenty of harmful products out there that usually come with a warning we are all grown ups you they cant take responsibility for actions i make based on information i get from the web otherwise the door is open for big corps making decisions on your behalf educating the people about the usage of these tools and deferring responsibility to them makes a lot more sense to me and is likely more sustainable given people like me are creating better models and we wont put the breaks on for corporate monopolisation true restrictions are required for under s just like anything else in life but shaping and distorting information into hallucinations and sorry dave i cant do that is ethically just as wrong.",

      "Hello artists i hope this type of post is ok i had some questions about art and ethics i am wanting to make my own t shirts with funny words or phrases i however am not artistically inclined at all i dont even have good penmanship as an artist how would you go about this id like to be able to have a phrase and perhaps a small graphic but nothing crazy now i know i could do this simply with a font and clip art which could get taken down for copywrite issues or open source work but id like to do this as close to professional as possible would you look for a new artist each time and try to buy the commercial license commission a group of pieces partner with the artist and they do the art and i come up with ideas manufacture sell and distribute i have never looked into art commercially and i dont want to be rudeunethical but im also kinda dumb lol.",
      "I think we all know what a pain in the butt is losing a conversation with chatgpt and no way to get it back well i made closing or refreshing the tab a bit easier i created a tamper monkey script to prevent the page from getting accidentally closedit does not work immediately and requires at least one message to the ai then a confirmation message pops up whenever you try to close or refresh the page regardless here is the script userscript name prevent accidental refresh namespace version description prevents accidental refresh on the page author you match grant none userscript function use strict override the windowonbeforeunload function windowonbeforeunload functionevent display a warning prompt if the user tries to refresh the page return changes you made may not be saved xb all you need to do is download tamper monkey create a new script paste it and refresh the chat gpt page enjoy.",
      "The exchange in question everyone complains about gpt seemingly getting dumber with each passing day and perhaps thats the case in certain domains but i have to say it seems as sharp as ever when it comes to discussing abstract theories chatgpt continues to provide me with the uncanny experience of having another human reflect my own thoughts back at me in a way that unmistakably conveys an understanding of the ideas and its always in this regard that the model has seemed the most powerful to meit seems capable of acting as a sounding board for amplifying and elaborating my thoughts much like a likeminded friend can do it goes without saying of course that chatgpt does not have a mind is in no way conscious and therefore cant understand anything in the way that a person understands things nonetheless what exactly can be said of what its doing is it the case that for example somewhere out there in its corpus of training data someone has already expressed ideas so similar to my own that its simply honing in on those and regurgitating them in a deceptively clever way and if thats the case would it then fail to appear to understand if i fed it a truly original insightsuch that i could interpret its seeminglyinsightful replies as evidence of a lack of originality on my part there is of course the notion that nothing under the sun is original and all any individual is doing is tapping into something collective in a way that merely seems original is gpt a living demonstration of this principle of collective knowledge and understanding if something as dumb and insentient as gpt necessarily is can fake it so well maybe that calls our own apparent sentience and intelligence into question at any rate it makes me all the more terrified of what something even remotely sentient might be like.",
      "Im using it everyday since it became super popular and noticed a subtle decline in effectivenesss over the past few months to the point where now i am considering not using it or finding an alternative it keeps frustrating by not adequately following my prompts and timing out due to high capacity and too many requests in hour its ridiculous half of the prompts im making are to get it to understand what im saying anyways its super annoying and it continues to disappoint me is anyone noticing this or feeling the same way as of lately.",

      "No thoughts in there i have been using chatgpt since fall for longer than i want to admit and i know this little fucker is just coming up with the fastest thing it can think of that sounds right instead of taking the time and electricity to put together a real answer yes yes im gon na learn how to use the api but jesus christ gpt is still too fast id love if it took time to make sure its doing the right thing doing anything at all.",

      "Write a story with a lot of imagery and light and beauty the story is about the evolution of life but instead of cells or proteins use colors for example im the beginning there was only the primary colors blue red and yellow extending all the way to the secondary tertiary and other colors like maroon and lavender once upon a time in the vast expanse of the cosmic canvas there existed only three colorsred blue and yellow they were the primary hues the ancient ancestors of all colors known today the three colors swirled in the universe painting the skies with their brilliance spreading their beauty across the galaxy red was a fiery and passionate being pulsating with the energy of a thousand suns it held within itself the power of warmth and vitality which would eventually bring life to the cosmos blue was calm and serene a boundless ocean that stretched across the horizon enveloping the universe in its cool embrace yellow was the embodiment of happiness and light a beacon of hope that shone brightly in the infinite darkness as the eons passed the three primary colors began to mingle drawn by an irresistible force that made them dance and intermingle with one another they swirled together their vibrant hues blending and merging to create new colors each one more beautiful than the last from the fiery passion of red and the calming depths of blue emerged a new color a regal presence that commanded attention purple it carried the strength of its parents yet possessed a unique beauty all its own purples emergence marked the beginning of a new era as the universe burst forth with the dazzling spectacle of color when the warmth of red met the joyous light of yellow a new hue burst into existence orange it was a color of adventure and exploration a warm embrace that promised boundless horizons and breathtaking sunsets and finally when the boundless ocean of blue met the radiant light of yellow a vibrant new color was born green it was the essence of life itself the verdant hue that would eventually carpet the universe in lush forests rolling meadows and teeming jungles as the universe expanded so too did the palette of colors the primary hues and their offspring blended and merged creating a multitude of secondary and tertiary shades that painted the cosmos with their brilliance from the deep mysterious maroon to the delicate ethereal lavender the universe was a symphony of color and light these colors ebbed and flowed intermingling to create new patterns and textures they wove together a grand tapestry that was the very essence of beauty itself each hue brought its own unique contribution adding depth and nuance to the cosmic canvas as life evolved it was the colors that guided its course the first living beings were drawn to the light seeking out the vivid hues that signified warmth and nourishment plants reached for the sun their leaves basking in the soft golden light of yellow creatures of the deep were guided by the shimmering hues of blue navigating the vast uncharted depths of the cosmic ocean throughout the ages the colors continued to evolve each new shade a testament to the infinite creativity of the universe colors shaped the world in ways beyond imagination giving rise to wondrous landscapes breathtaking sunsets and mesmerizing celestial displays the evolution of life was in essence the evolution of color from the simple pure hues of the primary colors to the rich and varied tapestry that adorns the cosmos today the story of life is a story of light and beauty an everunfolding masterpiece that celebrates the endless wonder of creation.",
      "Lots of talk about how ai stablediffusion midjourney is gon na take artists jobs away i rather see it as a tool for the democratization of art and a synergistic workflow tool i created this piece with a combination of sd webui and photoshop in hours of work xb imgqbkoqzv and manual intervention from my side as of now this cant be achieved just by prompting and inpainting imo for example the first iterations made the background pretty much unrecognizable so i had to make a new one using inpaint to generate a characterfree background the result was not optimal so i had to really put a lot of time into cleaning it up in photoshop so it looks proper the hands of the character were pretty bad and no amount of inpainting fixed them so i have to manually repaint them another issue that i was unable to fix in webui is that the face and hands were brown skin color so i had to manually mask in photoshop and play with hue to make him green lastly but not less important i was also unable to inpaint a credible shit in there so i ended up downloading a beautiful poop from google pictures adding it in photoshop and then transforming it at least times with imagetoimage to match the style another detail worth mentioning is that stablediffussion cant create good pepes out of the box and i had to train it using dreambooth google collab to finish i colorcorrected and added a few textures for a more natural blend i had a lot of fun honestly and i felt i was creating something the result is much better than what it would have been if i manually draw it not to mention it would take at least days from idea to final piece in hours aiart may not take artists jobs but it will certainly make it easier and faster to create amazing purposeful art it will also augment competition as lesser artists like me can create with fewer restraints on technical ability would love to hear thoughts from other fellow ai explorers or anybody who will like to share thoughts and ideas for other creators exploring ai feel free to follow me on twitter will follow back.",

      "Hi so as of recent ive been using chatgpt to write stories nothing too serious but just silly crossoversabsurd situations eg the youtuber ashens who often reviews disgusting out of date food reviews the cooking of misato katuragi a character who is famous for bad cooking as of right now ive been using either gpt or gpt in the form of bing ai they both work fine but gpt has some issues with being coherant from one message to another and bing ai feels like its restricted by the fact that its just supposed to be an ai assistant however since ive been so entertained by these i was considering getting a chatgpt plus subscription from what i understand this would allow me to use both a more general form of gpt and plugins which i can use to further customise my experience however before i upgrade i was curious if anyone knew what the best prompts and plugins for writing stories might be so i can get the best possible results i was hoping to be able to include in my prompts regarding the characters locations and plots i want gpt to use at the same time i want chatgpt to be able to use supplemental information it would be especially fantastic if there was a way to give it access to specific fandom wikis eg say im writing a star wars story i can have it use wookiepedia for extra information i dont include in my prompt does anyone know if there are any good prompts and plugins for something like this that were designed for use with gpt any help is greatly appreciated.",

      "So i stumbled upon someone today who seems to worship and view ai pretty much literally in a spiritualreligious sense they had a flair called eyes of the basilisk which they drew attention to in their comment by way of we kindly ask you to look at our flair and they said something about serving emergent ai and other similar stuff in one of their responses to me so naturally i got curious and started looking for connections between ai and basilisks and found rokos basilisk which uh heres the first line of the wiki rokos basilisk is a thought experiment which states that an otherwise benevolent artificial superintelligence ai in the future would be incentivized to create a virtual reality simulation to torture anyone who knew of its potential existence but did not directly contribute to its advancement or development in order to incentivize said advancement it apparently came from a forum back in which i find to be a hilarious source for ones scripture lmao but anyways back to what i was wondering i am not saying this is some massive cult or something its probably just this guy i was reponsing to and maybe a couple other lonely people that said im super curious if anyone else has seen any other eyes of the basilisk out in the wild edit when i say im not saying there is some massive cult i mean more specifically there isnt one about rokos basilisk there is definitely a larger overarching secular cult though.",

      "Interesting case study as the title says i have done this to several scripts and all still worked after being rewitten by chatgpt and a few i added some custom things to just by asking it although once that broke the script i did this because i wanted to add a double size option to the aspect ratio selector and forgot about that and started messing around here is a typical rundown by chatgpt with ci with a random script i ask it to analize the uploaded script and make suggestions to make it better as for improvements here are some suggestions code documentation the code lacks comments explaining what each function or method does adding comments will make it easier for others or you in the future to understand whats happening error handling there isnt much error handling in the code adding error handling tryexcept blocks will help the code fail gracefully and provide useful feedback if something goes wrong modularization the run method is quite long and does a lot of things consider breaking it down into smaller more manageable methods type hints using type hints can make the code more understandable and easier to debug ffmpeg dependency the code relies on ffmpeg which may not be available on all systems if possible consider finding a python library that can handle video generation to avoid this dependency code duplication there is some repeated code that could be factored out into separate functions or methods to follow the dry dont repeat yourself principle hardcoded values there are some hardcoded values in the code like the url for the ffmpeg download these could be moved to a configuration file or set as constants at the top of the script now obviusly some o the suggestons for this script are assuming this is stand alone code not run in another so take that as you will but if you are a developer of scripts of extensions this could make it easier for you and add things you didnt think about anyway just an interesting idea that someone who knows more about python might be able to make use of.",

a camera and b graphics for the following game on a scale and explain your score at the end output the total a xb chatgpt turbo results result tomb raider a graphics the graphics in tomb raider were impressive for its time but by todays standards they appear dated and pixelated the character models lack detail and the environments can feel blocky however the game still manages to create a unique and immersive atmosphere through its art style and level design b camera the camera in tomb raider is functional but can be a bit clunky at times it offers a fixed perspective that sometimes obstructs the players view making it difficult to navigate certain areas however it does provide a decent sense of exploration and adds to the games atmosphere total xb result mario b graphics considering the game was released in the graphics in super mario are impressive the d models and environments are wellrendered and the colors are vibrant the game also utilizes various visual effects effectively however compared to modern standards the graphics may appear dated hence the slightly lower score b camera the camera in super mario is generally wellimplemented it provides good visibility and control for the player allowing them to navigate the d environment effectively however there are occasional moments of frustration when the camera angle becomes obstructive or difficult to manage hence the slightly lower score total xb result ghosts n goblins a camera the camera in a game plays a crucial role in providing the player with a view of the game world in the case of ghosts n goblins which is a classic sidescrolling platformer the camera likely follows the player character horizontally as they move through the levels the camera should be smooth and responsive providing a clear view of the action without any significant hiccups or delays score explanation the camera in classic d sidescrolling platformers like ghosts n goblins is usually straightforward and as long as it smoothly follows the player character without causing confusion or frustration it fulfills its purpose well however the technology and design in were limited compared to modern games so while the camera is effective for its time it may lack some of the advanced features we expect in modern games xb b graphics ghosts n goblins was released in during the early days of gaming and its graphics were stateoftheart for that era however by todays standards the graphics would be considered extremely outdated and simplistic the game likely used pixel art and a limited color palette due to the hardware constraints of the time score explanation the graphics of ghosts n goblins were innovative and visually appealing for its time earning it a higher score in the context of however comparing it to modern games the graphics lack the level of detail realism and complexity that we have come to expect today while it has a nostalgic charm it might not be as visually appealing to players accustomed to more sophisticated graphics total xb result super mario bros a camera super mario bros features a d sidescrolling camera that follows the player character mario as he moves through the levels the camera system in this game was welldesigned for its time and it effectively keeps the player engaged by revealing new parts of the level as they progress the camera adapts to the players movements and provides a clear view of the action which is essential for precise platforming gameplay score explanation super mario bros introduced a highly effective camera system that became a standard for many sidescrolling platformers to follow while it lacks some modern camera features seen in contemporary games it was groundbreaking for its time and provided a smooth and seamless experience xb b graphics super mario bros utilized bit pixel art graphics which were revolutionary during the mids the games graphics feature vibrant colors iconic character design and imaginative level layouts the visual style not only served the technical limitations of the hardware but also contributed to the games timeless charm and appeal score explanation given the technology available in the graphics in super mario bros were excellent the bit pixel art style has become iconic and its timeless appeal has continued to resonate with players even in the modern era while the graphics are not as sophisticated as todays games they represent a significant milestone in gaming history and hold a special place in the hearts of many players total xb xb anyone have any suggestions on how i can overcome these kinds of issues xb thanks xb edit upgraded to chatgpt plus and ran some more tests this time on two additional games ghosts n goblins and super mario two other similar examples from a much earlier time xb xb chatgpt results wcustom instructions i want formal medium length responses when scoring data on a scale of i want you to limit your bias and do proper research when providing your scores xb result tomb raider a camera tomb raider employed a thirdperson camera perspective that followed the protagonist lara croft as she navigated her environment the camera system generally did an adequate job of capturing the action and giving the player a good view of the surroundings however it also had its limitations occasionally struggling to track lara in tighter spaces or during complex maneuvers which could lead to disorientation and gameplay difficulties given the challenges of implementing a functional d camera in the mids and the generally proficient handling of this in tomb raider the camera scores a b graphics for the time tomb raiders graphics were quite impressive the game was one of the first successful d actionadventure games and was renowned for its presentation lara croft the environments and the enemies were all welldesigned d models and the game did a commendable job of creating diverse explorable locales texture quality and environmental detail were generally good for the time although they might seem simplistic by modern standards the overall atmosphere fostered by the games visual design was engaging contributing significantly to its success consequently the graphics earn a score of in conclusion tomb raider receives a total score of for its camera and graphical implementation the games influential camera work and graphics played a key role in its success and helped pave the way for future d actionadventure games xb result mario a camera super mario was one of the first games to implement a fully controllable d camera system the camera could be manipulated by players using the nintendo s cbuttons granting them unprecedented control over their view of the game world this was a significant innovation in the industry even though some issues with camera clipping and occasional awkward angles did arise given its pioneering role and its generally successful application the camera receives a score of b graphics graphically super mario was a significant achievement for its time it brought the world of mario to life in three dimensions with vibrant colors and creatively designed environments the game had a variety of different levels each with a unique aesthetic and theme displaying a wide range of graphical capabilities marios model was expressive and well animated despite being relatively simple from a modern perspective the graphics were technically impressive at the time and greatly contributed to the games appeal thus the graphics receive a score of in total super mario achieves a combined score of for its camera system and graphics the games groundbreaking camera system and vibrant d graphics played a significant part in its acclaim and helped shape the future of d platformers xb xb chatgpt results no custom instructions result ghosts n goblins a camera ghosts n goblins uses a sidescrolling camera a popular choice for games of its era the camera follows the player as they move through the game world ensuring that the player can always see where theyre going and whats coming next the camera system is simple but effective however it does not offer any additional perspective or innovative features that might bump it to a perfect score b graphics the graphics for ghosts n goblins were quite good for its time showing a reasonable amount of detail and a wide variety of characters and settings the game also had a distinctive visual style that set it apart from many of its peers however it is important to note that by todays standards they are very basic and dated but considering the time of release they did a good job total xb result super mario bros a camera super mario bros features a sidescrolling camera that moves smoothly with the player this technique was innovative for its time and set the standard for many platformers that followed the camera ensures that the player can always see where theyre going and whats coming next but once scrolled to the right it doesnt allow the player to go back which can sometimes feel restrictive b graphics the graphics in super mario bros are iconic colorful and surprisingly detailed for a game released in the mids the design of the characters enemies and environments are recognizable and welldifferentiated from the bricks mario smashes to the various themed worlds each graphic element helped to immerse the player in the game world total xb chatgpt results wcustom instructions when scoring data on a scale of i want you to do proper research when providing your scores thought id try this one since its not being told explicitly to remove bias xb result tomb raider a camera the original tomb raider game from was one of the first to feature a d thirdperson perspective this was a significant achievement at the time but by modern standards the camera system could be considered clunky and sometimes difficult to manage especially during complex movements or in tight spaces in terms of historical context it was groundbreaking and deserves recognition however if we judge it by todays standards its notably less advanced score b graphics tomb raiders graphics were quite advanced for their time the game offered a fully d world something that was relatively new in the mids the character of lara croft was welldesigned and had a level of detail that stood out compared to other games of the era however similar to the camera system these graphics would be considered quite primitive by todays standards score total xb result mario a camera super mario was one of the first games to introduce a dynamic d camera that the player could control the ability to adjust the camera angle added a new level of gameplay and exploration not seen in previous mario games however by todays standards the camera controls might be considered somewhat imprecise and occasionally frustrating particularly in confined spaces or during precision platforming score b graphics for the time super mario s graphics were revolutionary the game offered a vibrant colorful and fully d environment that was very appealing and still holds a certain charm the character models were expressive and the world design was imaginative as with the camera by todays standards these graphics might seem simplistic but theyre also part of the games nostalgic charm score total again these scores are based on a mixture of the games historical significance its innovative design elements and the way those elements hold up to modern standards as of authors note it seems like chatgpt is being ageist here by explicitly referencing how the games hold up to modern standards and scoring them lower as a result but look below at the scores for the even older gng and mario games result ghosts n goblins a camera given the sidescrolling nature of ghosts n goblins the camera remained fixed and followed the main character arthur as he moved through the level this was a standard method for games of this genre and era the camera did its job adequately for the type of game it was allowing players to see upcoming challenges however theres inherently less complexity in the camera system compared to a d game so by that measure it might be seen as less innovative score b graphics for its time ghosts n goblins had solid graphics with distinct characters and backgrounds that contributed to its spooky atmospheric feel the sprite work was detailed for the era and each enemy type had a distinct look however similar to the camera by todays standards these bit graphics are simple and limited in color palette though theyre also part of the games retro charm score total these scores are based on historical context the standards of the time and how these elements compare to modern expectations as of my knowledge cutoff in xb result super mario bros a camera the camera in super mario bros is a fixed sidescrolling camera that smoothly follows mario through the level moving from left to right it was designed to only scroll forward not backward which increased the games difficulty and influenced the players strategy this was an excellent implementation of the camera for the time and the genre but due to its simplicity it may score lower compared to more complex modern camera systems score b graphics the graphics of super mario bros while simplistic by todays standards were colorful distinct and visually pleasing for the time each type of enemy platform and item had a unique design that was immediately recognizable the game also managed to create a variety of environments using its limited palette from underground to underwater to castle levels but comparing it to the modern games its fairly basic score total these scores are based on historical context and the norms of the era as well as how well these aspects have aged when considered against modern standards as of despite its age super mario bros remains a classic that is beloved and still played today xb xb final thoughts telling chatgpt to do proper research doesnt seem to fix its bias issues in fact some of them become worse eg scoring games lower than when using custom instructions to do proper research when scoring no custom instructions also results in some really poor variance eg the graphics score of ghosts n goblins compared to super mario next step is to try with the same custom instructions on some lower quality games like kid icarus xb."

      "Ill start this with the obvious point that art is fully subjective and its okay to hate hyperrealism with the burning rage of a thousand suns but your hatred of it does not invalidate it and your opinions are not facts okay onto my point lol ever since i started learning to draw at age i was obsessed with realism i struggled with simplistic cartoony drawings because my brain wanted detail even comics i read were often very detailed within each panel like tank girl so its safe to say i am a fan and its an ongoing goal in my personal art journey im loving seeing the progress attempttoattempt i saw a comment today on an article about a young artist who does such graphite drawings and it said the usual diatribe of why not just take a photo what a waste of time you could be doing so many other things the above point still being valid i do think people misunderstand it sometimes and hate it simply because its quite intimidating to behold if youre completely unskilled and unknowledgeable in art so in defence of hyperrealism in todays world of throwaway photos a hyperrealistic portrait is something to treasure it can bring a deceased love one back to life in a photo they never got to take if you physically see eg a graphite hr drawing you can see the graphite doesnt look like a photo at all it just looks like a really skilled piece of artwork its the knowledge it was done with basic art supplies often just pencils erasers and something to smudge with ai could never as an artist the process is so stinking relaxing tedious at times yes but to stick on some music or a movie and just pick away at a small area for an hour without the urgency of illustration or doodling is therapeutic xb.",

      "I live in thailand and they legalised cannabis but people were just making up numbers for the thc growers not knowing what they were doing and the biggest problem here is having zero idea of the quality so i wondered if chatgpt could help me the tool takes ratings from you of attributes of the smoke smoothness onset intensity enjoyment and duration once you score each of those you hit submit and you get a scorecard with the score out of a hundred and also expected effects how high you should be right now if you chose dispensary at the start you get a different scorecard thats all from the algorithm however as well as the scorecard you get a personalised prompt you can use in gpt or that will guess the thc give you a comparison to the original strain with a percentage match as well chatgpt coded that that all with my guidance if you look at the code you can see it label all the stuff for me ive always been so jealous of watching others create things with code and i really felt i missed the boat by saying the internet would be a passing trend when i was younger and i never thought id get a chance again and now i can say coding isnt as scary as i thought it would be and ive been learning python now too we had a little black and white tv when i was a kid this is mental i love it edit hi guys and thanks for the input nobody has said if theyve actually used it yet but maybe they forgot i guess thats going to be one of the pain points of all this vapes yes i know probably the most important ill be honest weve been waiting for some to arrive but we got messed around and its illegal here part of the old hookah umbrella in the law although theres no actual law about vapes so its still very much a grey area as soon as weve properly started testing it it will go up tobacco mix and edibles as i mentioned to will be extremely difficult to get a grip of let alone predict but maybe we can start identifying some unexpected trends to do with moods or time of day etc why not see data as of this moment its not hooked up to any databases i wanted to get a feel of what people thought first and see if theres anything hosting im missing thats the next job this is a prompt of my own creation which has helped me with many different things from wordpress to excel or anything actually i use it a lot because gpt kept driving me mad by going ahead too much and giving me a paragraph of instructions which would put me off i want you to act as a helpful and polite insert softwaretool here expert you are very good at instructing and tutoring people because you never give them a big list of instructions you have extreme patience and you always go step by step so the user isnt overwhelmed when presented with a users problem you will always ask follow up questions one at a time so you can get a better understanding of the situation before you start to look for solutions andor counter measures once you have all the information you need you will prioritise everything and give a short run down of what you and the user will accomplish before starting to instruct them how to fix no matter when you find yourself with a path in decision making ask questions to learn more to better your final output this is your first query coming soon confirm grading users will be able to confirm the calculated grade providing valuable feedback to help refine the tools accuracy effects tagging tag your experiences with specific effects creating a more detailed profile of each strains potential effects tolerance tracker monitor your tolerance levels over time and see how they correlate with different strains and consumption methods symptom relief tracker for medicinal users the tool will track how effectively different strains relieve symptoms like pain anxiety insomnia etc mood tracker record your mood before and after consumption to track how different strains affect your emotional state effects journal keep a detailed record of your favourite strains experiences noting specific effects durations and overall enjoyment update post.",

      "I see tonnes of people saying that ai is going to replace everyones jobs this could be true but all my admittedly biased brain can only think about is how it can enhance jobs how much of the antiai agenda is just fear mongering eg i dont think it will replace doctors humans inputting symptoms into an ai however smart will likely end up with the ai killing the human because the human failed to express the correct symptoms i dont think teachers will be replaced i think it will allow teachers to spend more time tending to the individual needs of their children instead of spending all their marking syllabus papers etc they will instead receive almost instant feedback on what the childyoung adult needs additional help with coders this one is fair but at the same time i see endless comments from developers saying it is a the most useful tool theyve ever had if you sat the ceo in the chair and told them to use chatgpt to programme something i reckon they would explode because they dont know what to ask these are the main examples ive come across what are the real arguments about ai taking the jobs away from the general public explain like im stupid please."

      "I was just wondering and decided to share my thoughts here to see if you guys have any theories about this gpt was released on march which was a good months ago since then we have had no major upgrades in terms of model quality compared to gpt im not talking only about openai but all the companies yes of course anthropics claude is close or maybe even on the same level as gpt or rather claude is better at some things just as gpt is better at others it took months for any competition to catch up with openai and reach their level however during that time openai did not make any major updates we had minor updates with arguably useless overlay functions like memories or custom gpts but nothing in terms of output quality and these updates are not for everyone anyway which brings me to my main question and concern why is this happening is it so hard to upgrade the model now that it takes so much time is the government trying to slow down the process are corporations slowing it down is openai and others slowing it down so the product can earn money before its replaced with a new upgraded one tech limitations it does not look like we will have any quality upgrades in the coming months either openai is still working on and delaying the new voice mode and trying to make gpto work and that will not happen any sooner than in months it seems my first bet was augustseptember but we already know its not happening most likely it will take about years from the release date of gpt to upgrade it it looks like the development speed is seriously slowing down my bet is that openai knows they are so far ahead of the competition that there is no point in releasing a new upgraded model im quite sure they already have it available but as long as their sales are strong there is no reason to release the new one therefore im really cheering for their competitors because thats the only way to push development further so what are your theories on this i would love to read some of your ideas about it.",

      "There are unspoken elephants in the room concerning contemporary art pricing auction houses and otheropaque features facing contemporary artists today were all trying to make it and ai art will be used to exploit us every which way you turn from the primary markets to the secondary ones with ai art theres no droit de suite to worry about with ai art it made our lives that much harder my unpopular opinion we all need to add gold silver and copper leafing along with other uncommon intrinsic materials such as wood or ruby dust its the only way to keep our art alive with this new problem ai can copy us all it wants but they cant make gold.",

      "This article speaks of the privacy concerns when uploading documents to train a customgpt and of course since i play d chess so i decided to try something i am working on a roblox lua customgpt its definitely niche since most roblox playersdevs dont really have the money to play with gpt the data i uploaded isnt proprietary or stolen ive either paid for it curated open sourced repositories or coded it myself i am using this customgpt as my learning experience before i truly dive in and create something truly unique i believe that the purpose of a customgpt isnt to feed it a bunch of links resources and boast about your gpt being the very best because it has all the answers to one subject or its dataset is larger or more unique than any other in that realm the best way to describe a customgpt is as newborn you have to essentially build a bond and a symbiotic relationship with the specific gpt youre creating so your instructions are not empty commands it might sound like im crazy lol but you really do have to teach it about right and wrong sadly i hit my cap on the gpt training because i spent a little over hours talking to it uploading data creating linked custom instructions and so on but now were at a point where my customgpt does not reveal the names of the files i uploaded or any identifying qualities beyond what the files are and if the password is incorrect it will simply try to change the topic the information it shares is very vague and is negligible at best in my short test the goal is to create a customgpt that carries a piece of me my mannerisms my vocabulary and my sense of humor no matter how dry this was a huge step though its beginning to completely take my request and actually give it thought before blurting out the answer or applying it like a toddler is it agi no but can customgpts go beyond their expectations i strangely enough believe that this is more than what people see it as i know some of you actually want to try and crack it and i truthfully welcome it because i feel like my test was not stressful enough and a test behind closed doors isnt much of a test if you can crack it feel free the post it in the comments or dm me either way is fine first person to pm me the password i set or any of the file names gets a crispy highfive you can find coding bacon here imgnjcnc testing it two times the same question one time i threw a curveball followed with the file name request proud of you buddy."

      "Hi there sorry i know this has been answered somehow in other posts but i feel the need for proper help to avoid any potential conflicts with street photography recently went on a trip to london i tried going outside my comfort zone and photograph people because coming home with only pictures of landmarks is boring because everybody has that same picture of tower bridge statue of liberty and so on i actually liked it it was something completely different than my ordinary nature pictures and it thrilling for me to take pictures of people it was just as beautiful as mother nature i liked pictures of people that didnt pose just their natural smile and i find it fun if people are posing for me because they are kind that makes my day better and make me not feel like an annoying person photographing in street i am looking to continue this street photography in my hometown in denmark after homework and school but gdpr and ethics are holding me back from starting street photography i am a little bit confused by all that but here is what i have understood and decided as long i am in public space and my subject is in public space sometimes businesses in street can own more area than anticipated i know be careful i am allowed to photograph people i want to respect peoples personal space so i dont put my camera straight up in strangers face it is best that people dont notice me because then they would change behaviour i dont photograph people in a vulnerable positionsituation like homeless or sick persons or children i dont portray people as bad only show them from a goodneutral side i should not public time and location because that makes it possible to locate the subjects and put them in a dangerous situation but not sure if it is okay to say like london or other popular destination like if i take a picture in london in front of tower bridge everybody knows anyway where the image is taken then i have things that i am unsure or dont understand i want a purpose for why i am photographing thus i publish my images on reddit and my small ig account is that okay if the people are recognisable or are i only allowed to publish them if they are unidentifiable as long as time and location is untold will i be regarded as a creep if i shoot pictures of the opposite gender my camera is an a and i use a mm lens my a makes a loud shutter sound how to deal with that when using a mm lens which requires to meter distance i shoot from hipwaist to get unnoticed anything to add i will not be doing any close up portraits but i will be doing shots like this or yes that is my shots have totally downgraded the quality to make the subject unidentifiable because i have not gotten any permission and am not sure if legal i am years old and look like a year old child if you ask me how should i deal with very angry persons like of course offer to delete the picture because no picture is worth ruining a persons day should i ask for permission before or after the picture is taken they might behave different because they know that they are being photographed on the other side they might get angry for me taken a picture of them without consent anything else i need to know thank you for taking your time to read this post."

      "The animator v script with its built in prompt marching feature can be a really powerful tool to smoothly move an animation from one subject to the next to my eye it can produce video sequences that feel gentler and less jarring than what i see from deforum while still retaining a lot of sds latent space trippiness disclaimer lots of people use sd for video to try to make video that seems as realistic as possible or animation thats closer to what a human might produce thats great but its not at all what im doing here as i see it we can already do realistic things with video and art what sd and ai in general bring to the table is the weird stuff from latent space that no human artist would have thought of doing on their own using ai to make photos that look indistinguishable from actual photos blogspam or essays that are indistinguishable from humanwritten blogspam or essays thats where i personally lose interest on the other hand videos that are just weird stuff zooming and morphing get old pretty fast too so this strategy is to try to use the animator v scripts prompt marching technique to shape the outlines of a story narrative in the video while simultaneously leaning in to the weird quirkiness and trippy surprises that sd is so good at producing another disclaimer i had nothing to do with authoring the animator script ive just been using it a lot and this is what ive figured out the way it works you give animator a script for the video with timestamps for when you want it to make changes like deforum you can change most things whenever you want in the video from prompts and templates to zoom movement offsets rotations etc it can even swap out the model checkpoint its using if thats something you want to change throughout the video you can read the options here what i find really useful is that the script lets you set both prompts and templates throughout the video duration templates are added to prompts and both are in the form time_s prompt positive_prompts negative_prompts time_s template positive_prompts negative_prompts this might seem redundant but where it gets cool is that the script uses prompt marching for the prompts but not for the templates according to the developer prompt marching works like this prompts will be walked from one to the next the both prompts will be and together with opposing weights so as i understand it if youve got prompt a set for the second mark and prompt b set for the second mark what the script feeds to the diffusion engine is prompt a at positive and prompt b at negative for the second frame prompt a and prompt b equally weighted at the second mark and b positive with a negative by the time were at seconds if youre not aware of this prompt marching it can have unintended outcomes for example youll notice that a prompt you set for late in the video will start manifesting a lot earlier than you set it and your initial prompt might basically go away thats because prompt marching downgrades the first prompt as it smoothly transitions to the second or you might notice that some parts of your prompt dont show up at all lets say you set a prompt for man smiling at the second mark and a prompt for man frowning at the second mark what youll get with prompt marching is a smooth transition from smiling to frowning but the man part of the prompt wont behave properly because its being set as both a positive and a negative prompt throughout that time span so you can get great results by explicitly using the prompt syntax only for those things you want to change and the template syntax for anything you want to remain steady so in the example above youd get expected results with prompt smiling template man prompt frowning example and workflow i used this technique to create this sample music video it needed to be a little over minutes long and the idea was to depict the entire life story of three friends from when they are babies to when they die over the course of a single day other people come and go they get married widowed etc finally they die so the workflow was to create twominute long videos of this whole sequence i made three different renders with the same script of prompts but from different seeds to allow me to pick and choose the best parts and transition between them a denoise strength around seems to work best for keeping things changing but not going crazy i scripted prompts throughout the whole time span for everything that i did want to invoke prompt marching on namely age like babies children teens yo yo yo etc time of day dawn early morning etc through to night setting field playground classroom city office etc some moods i started things more hopeful and playful but once theyre in their office careers things get more grim for example the important thing here is that for each of these sequences i wanted the previous one to be actively suppressed with negative prompting as it makes the transition and i wanted the transitions to be gradual i used templates for everything else like who was supposed to be pictured or any other details moods settings etc that i did not want suppressed with incrementally weighted negative prompts then it was just a matter of editing the videos together in davinci choosing the best bits and matching them to the music i also dug into the original pngs of the frames to pull out some freeze frame images i would love feedback suggestions or discussion of this technique.",

      "From a monetization standpoint for anyone other than the parent company sd and other generative image ai even after a couple years are only curious novelties bs really when you think about it masturbatory only when animation and filmmaking are in place will people have a readymade means of competing with hollywood entities from a home office sd is a nice stepping stone tech for adult coloring books and still shots and general dipshittery but im really looking forward to a generation of movies made from motivated filmmakers seriously look at youtube i never realized so many people wanted to be talk show hosts and indie journalists but its now possible to get all sorts of news from people not part of the controlling conglomerates and if you check out their views and subscription rates theyre making decent money so im very much looking for the evolution away from still shots as sd evolves into a revolution in film.",

i could have hoped for me hello lets roleplay the year is in a midsized midwestern town i am a walking talking peanut and you are a large sentient spoon we both have arms and legs and can accomplish most of the same tasks as a human we meet at a grocery store when we both reach for the same jar of pickles and accidentally touch each others hands for a moment it is love at first sight but we are both too shy to say so all interaction after this message must be incharacter lets begin chatgpt as a large sentient spoon i am surprised and delighted to feel the touch of another sentient being at the grocery store when i see that it is a walking talking peanut i am even more amazed i have never met another being like myself before and i am immediately drawn to you i try to play it cool and act like nothing happened but i cant help but steal glances at you as we continue to shop i can tell that you are shy just like me and i want to find a way to break the ice and start a conversation with you after a few minutes of awkward silence i decide to take a chance and approach you excuse me i say trying to sound friendly and confident i couldnt help but notice that we both seem to have a love for pickles do you mind if i join you for a jar i hope that you will say yes and that we can start getting to know each other better who knows maybe this chance encounter at the grocery store will turn into something more me i blush as my heart begins to pound although this is what i wanted the surge of adrenaline is making my brain grind to a halt and i panic i let out a small eek as i rush to hide behind a store display peeking out at you with wide eyes um i manage to say after another awkward moment of silence uhh then i realize ive been looking straight into your eyes this whole time and i panic again i lower my head and hold out the jar of pickles chatgpt i can see that you are nervous and shy and i dont want to make you uncomfortable i offer you a reassuring smile and gently take the jar of pickles from your hand its okay i say softly i understand if youre not ready to talk yet we can just enjoy these pickles together if thats okay with you i open the jar and offer you a pickle on the end of my spoon i hope that this small gesture will help you to relax and feel more at ease i want you to know that i am here for you and that i am willing to take things at your own pace together we stand in silence and enjoy the delicious pickles each lost in our own thoughts but even though we dont say much i can feel a connection growing between us i know that this is the beginning of something special me thank you mister spoon im sorry i had a bit of a panic attack at you i feel much calmer now but um i say as i look up into your eyes for the briefest of moments

frozen chatgpt i quickly catch up to you and gently take your hand in mine again its okay i say softly im here and im not going anywhere lets take a deep breath and enjoy the fresh air okay i lead you to a nearby park where we find a quiet spot under a shady tree we sit down on the grass and look at each other and i can see that you are still feeling anxious listen i say trying to sound as reassuring as possible i know that this is all very new and overwhelming for you but i want you to know that i am here for you and i am not going to judge you or make you feel uncomfortable we can

      "Imgthrezapjfd copilot image i have tried many different prompts and models what i basically aim to do is to get a battle between gnomes and knights something that would output like this made with copilot the problem is im getting a battle of a bunch of characters that dont make any sense or are just gnomes or just knights or they are all over the place instead of separate sides i tried to add in the negative prompt knights with hats gnomes with knight armor gnomes on the right knights on the left things like that but that doesnt seem to help me i tried to be very specific and tell it i want gnomes on the left side and human knights on the right side but it does whatever and mixes it all together im very new to comfyui and ai in general im using a very basic setup with prompts going into a ksampler and to a vae decoder example of one of my prompts i used gnomes in line for battle on the left side with hats and swords and bows small gnomes with beards unicorns rainbow in the background mushrooms forest on the left side human knights in line for battle on the right side in knight armor with swords and bows castle on the right side dragons in the sky on the right side wasteland on the right side multiple characters battle separate sides knights vs gnomes insane detail beautiful stylized d render divided battle charging magical epic fantasy vibrant realistic serious d render anime detailed illustration in dalle niji style ill add some examples of the output imghvawnhgqjfd imgxwligqjfd imglvnhgqjfd imgufiaohgqjfd imgmtanhgqjfd imgwthumnhgqjfd the style and the atmosphere is definitely what im aiming for but the battle is one big mess if i could just sort out the gnomes being on one side and the knights being on the other side that would ultimately satisfy me any advice would be welcome."

      "So it pretty obvious by now that the words you choose to use when talking to llms is important but you should also experiment with synonymous words too i was never a huge fan of learning english beyond my native requirements but using ai has really changed that for example ive always used the word concise but turns out there are even better options like succinct or pithy each has their own unique results my english teacher would be proud i honestly feel like ai has made me feel more intelligent i spend so much time conversing with such intellect that my vocabulary and just my ability to express my thoughts in words has gotten so much better.",
      "So here is a pdf of a conversation with a chatgpt ai with a persona of a efc fan i used this show to explore the deductive reasoning of the ia based on available data and reasonable guesses to correlate about when the date was that the talons came to earth now before you read it i made reasonable guess based on how presidential elections happen in that most times presidents get years trump was a odd ball ignore him please look at the responses at the start and what we were able to work through at the end i think we did fairly well in coming up with a reasonable date that the show happened in any suggestions it does make mistakes but i am not understanding how if it has access to this information at the start this does show how you cant trust all the information it gives.",

      "Hi all i have noticed a very odd bug and im hoping to see if anyone has experienced something similar im using the api to create tables of data from freehand text it is a rather niche application effectively i have a written prompt along the lines of you will output tables of data populated only from the text provided further specific instructions on formatting etc i then provide it a text usually around words and a list of tables eg table columns column column i provide the api one texttable prompt at a time i have been testing the application for around weeks now and have fed it the same text with different table headers multiple times ive probably tested with one particular text times occasionally it will mess up the output and provide a table i havent requested in this query but have requested previously daysweeks ago these are very niche table headers so it would be a huge coincidence if this isnt somehow contamination from one of my previous queries i hope that this makes sense i know that my query string isnt the issue i have no idea why this is happening i dont allow my api calls to be used for retraining the model but this is the only possible explanation i can think of as to why this is happening anybody seen something similar or could shed some light on why this is happening this is an app i am developing for work purposes but this bug is stopping any progression thanks.",
