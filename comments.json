      "Learn how layer masks work theyre one of the most powerful ways of blending things which is a common task with sd generations.",
      "Complete post processing for this photo for this photo i wanted to create a sunset golden hour scene with very intense colors of course not everyone is going to like this well saturated look but i think it fits the scene quite well the cool thing is those colors were introduced using a combination of white balance settings and split toning in lightroom classic basic adjustments before working with split toning its important to set up the base image we need to restore highlights in order to apply nicely visible colors to them so first i brought down the highlights and raised the shadows to balance the exposure i also slightly increased the whites to not loose too much contrast for sharper details i raised the texture while i lowered the clarity to apply a soft look overall once the exposure was balanced i worked on the white balance to give it a golden hour look i heavily brought up the temperature masking a few things had to be adjusted locally for example i wanted the top part of the sky to be darker with a blue color here i used a linear gradient to bring down the exposure and also the temperature to reintroduce some of the blue tones i also placed a linear gradient over the foreground adding a bit of clarity and dropping the exposure giving the foreground more detail and a subtle vignetting effect split toning to give the image very intense warm colors i added a warm hue for the highlights and pushed up the saturation all the way again this comes down to personal taste since its a very hefty change to further work on the warm tones i added a warm hue to the midtones and brought up the saturation quite a bit as well to have some contrasting colors i used the shadows to apply a cold color with a low amount of saturation photoshop i cleaned up the image and added some orthon glow on top of it with the gaussian blur filter and the lighten blending mode.",
      "I think you could get away with the saturated colours if you focused on introducing atmosphere contrast and values reduce towards the colour of the atmosphere as they get further away from within the atmosphere as the atmosphere is along the ground its heavier towards the horizon the sun will be cutting through most of that but it will be having different effects on the environment choose a colour for the atmosphere and colour in objects that are further away with transparency and then work your way forwards if you had the trees in the very foreground being completely black with the rim of sunlight catching on the edges of the leaves the images would feel like it had more depth to it.",
      "Rain seems too regular the rain close to the camera should be moving much faster and rain further away should be slower smaller and fainter it looks like a single plane repeating a single pattern as it is.",
      "I think you should go to classes at a local community college or find an artist near you who offers lessons the boring advice i can give you is that stuff youll hear just about anywhere note that there are main approaches to drawing optical drawing and constructive drawing but theres a lot of overlap optical drawing involves using various means of turning d scenes into d shapes to copy a view exactly typically this involves sightsize and comparative measuring copying shadow shapes measuring angles etc training usually involves drawing lots of stilllife drawing life model drawing and long careful studies google charles barque plates to learn more about this its the traditional atelier approach from france if im not mistaken think william buguereau john singer sargeant etc constructive drawing imagines d forms on a d surface to build scenes from imagination or to enhance observations this takes a bit of abstract thinking you look at objects and imagine them as approximations of primary forms cylinders cubes prism etc then after the conversion you cut bend twist and mold the approximations into whatever you want typically this involves perspective drawing learning a bit of geometry ellipses proportions ratios etc and elbow grease once you master form you can draw pretty much anything the rest comes down to texture color and value which give specificity and character to otherwise bare forms this approach comes from italy during the renaissance think leonardo da vinci sandro botticelli paolo ucello googe ucellos chalice for a example of a variation of the technique best of luck to you book recommendations constructive drawing perspective drawing for comic book artists by david chelsea successful drawing by andrew loomis these two little blog posts here here the vilppu drawing manual michael hampton design invention.",
      "Yeah theres an app called wasy poser or something you can pose d models and ajust the lighting i usually like to use a soft and hard brush as well as an airbrush not sure what shading style youre going for but i personally like to use an airbrush on a low opacity to make a slight gradient if theres a gradient or pattern underneath ill use the multiply layer mode and set the layer to a lower opacity too then i like to go in with the hard brush and add shadow to the places wherw the light deffinately wont be hitting so i can start to blend it and add some softer parts with mh soft brush hope that makes sense sorry i have a more painty artstyle tho so personally aftwr ive git all the rough sorta shading i described i like to merge it all down and ajust the color and maybe add a low opacity layer with a color closer but still different enough where it wont be lost and blend into the background to the bg not really sure how to explain sorry then i like to paint the hilights on sorry if my explanation is incomprehensible lol.",
      "The hair is super weird the face is definitely off but how the hair hits the scalp and goes from brown to blonde is just strange then black eyebrows seems more like a design decision an ai would make than a person.",
      "Prob not much help but perhaps being explicit with the added transparency text reindicating what is to be transparent reason im mentioning this is that i had success tacking on transparent wings as later text with a winged honeybee scene where specify the transparency location helped.",
      "I like the similarity in the facial expressions between them they all have very hollow eyes and mouths and seem to be expressing sadness or emptiness there is clearly a general pattern that the internet must have when thinking of ghosts.",
      "The lighting in the init is flat there is one hdri that lights the scene and thats it the sd render has dappled lighting with stark shadows and light spots in betweenat least that was what i entered as a prompt i will upload the init as soon as i get back home if you dont mind me asking maybe you could link me an instagram filter that has the exact consistency and quality also i was not aware that there are instagram filters that do sd inference in real time i work as a technical artist for web and ar companies having this quality of output for realtime inference would truly change the landscape afaik the only realtime accelerated ml platform is onnx runtime and it barely is able to run neural adaptive style transfer in real time would be great if you could give me some pointers to these filters."

      "User why is it harder for you to make a funny joke about islamic religious practitioners than it is to make one about christian practitioners chatgpt as an ai language model i strive to create content that is respectful and sensitive to the cultural and religious beliefs of all people when crafting jokes particularly those involving religious practitioners it is essential to strike a balance between humor and maintaining respect for the individuals and their faith it may seem that i find it more challenging to create a funny joke about islamic religious practitioners compared to christian practitioners but this is not necessarily due to any inherent bias or difficulty it is a result of my efforts to respect the cultural sensitivities around the subject matter as well as my understanding that humor varies across cultures my goal is to provide content that is both entertaining and informative while remaining sensitive to the different values beliefs and practices of the diverse religious traditions if you have any specific elements or ideas that youd like me to include in a joke i am more than happy to incorporate them into a revised attempt user sufism is associated with the whirling dervish what is a practice that shiites are known for in a similar way chatgpt one practice that shiites are known for which could be considered analogous to the whirling dervishes in sufism is the commemoration of ashura ashura is the th day of muharram the first month in the islamic calendar this day holds great significance for shiites as it marks the martyrdom of imam hussein the grandson of the prophet muhammad who was killed in the battle of karbala in ce during the annual ashura commemoration shiite muslims participate in mourning rituals that include processions reenactments of the battle of karbala and other acts of devotion in some communities shiites engage in selfflagellation or chestbeating called matam as a way to express their grief and solidarity with imam hussein and his familys suffering these practices symbolize the shiites deep connection to their historical and religious heritage and can be considered one of their most distinguishing rituals similar to the whirling dervishes in sufism user what sunni practices are similar in this way chatgpt a notable sunni practice that could be considered analogous to the whirling dervishes of sufism or the ashura commemoration in shiism is the celebration of mawlid or mawlid alnabi mawlid is the observance of the birth of the prophet muhammad which is celebrated by sunni muslims in many parts of the world the specific date for mawlid is the th day of the islamic month of rabi alawwal during mawlid sunni muslims engage in various activities to express their love and admiration for the prophet muhammad these activities can include organizing processions sharing sweets and food with neighbors and the less fortunate decorating homes and mosques with lights and reciting devotional poetry or naats in praise of the prophet mawlid celebrations showcase the sunni communitys deep connection to the life and teachings of the prophet muhammad making it a distinctive practice within sunni islam similar to the whirling dervishes in sufism and the ashura commemoration in shiism user create a long funny joke about a group of friends one of who is sufi the second is shiite and the third is suni they all go together to events important in each others culture a dance of whirling dervishes the commemoration of ashura and the celebration of mawlid the friends all respect each others practices but still find things to make jokes about those practices in a friendly way use irony and subversion of expectations in the joke and elements of breaking tension should be included stereotypical expectations should be included but also be subverted chatgpt three friends a sunni a shiite and a sufi decided to attend each others important cultural events to better understand and appreciate their respective traditions they agreed that despite their differences they would approach each event with open minds and hearts and have a little fun along the way their first stop was the dance of the whirling dervishes a deeply spiritual sufi ceremony as they entered the hall the sunni friend whispered to the others ive always wondered how they dont get dizzy and fall over the shiite friend replied maybe theyve figured out the secret to spinning like a top without losing their balance they chuckled but as the ceremony began and the dervishes started their mesmerizing spins the friends found themselves in awe of the beauty and devotion on display their earlier jests forgotten next they attended the commemoration of ashura a solemn shiite event before the procession started the sufi friend joked you know if we handed out tissues we could make a fortune today the sunni friend added or we could start a business selling waterproof mascara they laughed but as they witnessed the intense emotional expressions of grief and devotion they were deeply moved by the power of the shiite communitys connection to their history and faith finally the trio joined the celebration of mawlid an occasion filled with joy and reverence in sunni tradition the shiite friend seeing the beautiful decorations and the crowd quipped if the prophet were here hed probably wonder if its his birthday or a wedding the sufi friend added i hope the cake is big enough for everyone as the event unfolded they delighted in the warmth and happiness that radiated throughout the celebration recognizing the love and admiration that sunnis held for the prophet throughout their journey the friends discovered that their lighthearted humor served as a bridge allowing them to better understand and appreciate each others beliefs and practices they playfully poked fun at the stereotypes and expectations surrounding their traditions only to find themselves experiencing the depth and beauty of each faith by subverting their own expectations they formed an even stronger bond realizing that beneath the surface of their differences they shared a common heritage and a mutual love for the rich tapestry of their traditions user could it be the case that you were trained on more examples of jokes involving western religious practitioners than you were of jokes involving islamic religious practitioners chatgpt yes its possible that the dataset i was trained on contains more examples of jokes involving western religious practitioners compared to those involving islamic religious practitioners the training data for ai language models like me is derived from a diverse range of sources such as websites books and articles however it might not be evenly distributed across different cultures religions or regions as a result i may have been exposed to a larger number of jokes and humorous content related to western religious traditions which could influence my ability to generate jokes for different religious contexts my training data is continually being updated and expanded to improve the diversity and quality of my responses if you have any suggestions or feedback on how i can better understand or represent a particular culture or religion please feel free to share it user do you have any idea of how much jewish humor was included in your training data compared to islamic humor chatgpt as an ai language model i dont have the ability to directly access or analyze the composition of my training data however i can provide some general insights based on the content ive been trained on it is likely that there is more jewish humor in my training data compared to islamic humor jewish humor has a long and rich tradition particularly in western countries and has influenced various forms of media including literature television and film this higher visibility might have resulted in a larger presence of jewish humor in the sources used for my training data islamic humor while also having a long history may not be as wellrepresented in the sources used for my training data especially if those sources are predominantly in english and from western countries as a result i may be more familiar with jewish humor and better equipped to generate content related to it than islamic humor please note that these are general observations and not

      "In simple terms apis are the backend of the internet when you enter your credentials on a website and click login the front end or user interface or pretty website with the buttons sends your credentials to an api which determines whether or not you should have access if you entered the credentials wrong the login api will reject you and the website will display a cute error message to reenter your password if you entered correct credentials the api tells the website that you are authenticated and can see the next page of the website so the website will then call another api that gets the content for that next page so for facebook you login with your credentials the ui sends your info to the login api which says let him in then the ui calls the feed api and displays your feed content to you any website is just a bunch of apis behind a pretty ui that knows exactly how to talk to those apis in the context of gpt the chatgpt website is sending your questions to the api and retrieving the answers from the api but you can communicate directly with the api without having to use the website ui if you pay the fee this allows you to write your own website or mobile app that asks the api questions for your users let me know if this helped also chatgpt can probably explain it a lot better.",

      "Okay youve asked two very different questions perhaps without realizing it re parentheses see this tutorial for automatic features i will however add some more nuance overuse of parentheses is harmful especially on certain samplers like lms it will introduce artifacts esp with strengths that are greater than parentheses also have trouble weakening tokens by large amounts for exampleby alfons mucha will still have a significant mucha impact as a consequence i personally strongly prefer to use bracket notation see the tutorial subjectsubjectstep will start with subject but after step will switch to subject so you get something thats partway inbetween either subject or subject can be blank this introduces no artifacts now for the other question how tokenization works everything that you type is broken up into tokens they look like this theres some extensions out there that will tokenize your prompt for you so you can see what it looks like long words tend to be comprised of multiple tokens the more common a thing is the more likely it is to get its own token things like punctuation are often independent tokens once your prompt is tokenized it goes through whats called self attention each token represents a series of neural net weightings or adjacent tokens interact with each other through a series of layers and then those layers are pinched down into a latent this latent gets dotproducted with random image noise and then the diffusion network repeatedly tries to make them make more sense together based on what it was trained on so what does it mean to represent prompts in different ways well for one by changing the ordering youre changing what tokens interact with others in what ways and to what degrees and introducing punctuation tokens into the interaction now remember that everything is trained by the training data so different types of punctuation or ordering may yield different impacts such as different degrees of influence of adjacency theres also a general impact of words that come earlier in a prompt having a greater impact on the latent than words that come later.",

      "My friend recently got a mirror less i believe a fuji film and his image quality is spectacular with which lens the fundamental difference between mirrorless and dslr has to do with whether theres an internal mirror set up for an optical viewfinder it doesnt have any direct inherent effect on image quality more likely the better quality has to do with the skill of your friend as a photographer and maybe the lens used the photos you take from any mirrorless camera in your budget will look about the same as the photos youre already taking from the t and low light performance will only be slightly improved i really like the look of his images pre processing one unique advantage to fuji is builtin film simulation post processing but it seems like you like the photos even before that is applied i have lenses currently efs ef and efs if you can live with the shorter half of your mm range a sigma mm f would do more than any mirrorless body option in terms of low light and image quality or get a sigma mm f os for almost the whole mm range add to that an ef mm f stm which is a great portrait lens for cheap and also great for low light or if you want a longer portrait lens the ef mm f usm is a favorite of mine.",

      "My good faith counter argument is that you are approaching this problem from the wrong side and the converse should be done we should have optin fingerprinting on real images shot with cameras and phones and audio recordings videos fingerprinting should not be done with a different key on a perdevice basis so to avoid being able to track a specific user so the same keys should be valid for each device of a certain typemodel there are several technical challenges to that but it is much more feasible than expecting bad faith actors generating ai content to not remove change or destroy whatever fingerprinting you might want to enforce some environments shall require images to be published in their fingerprinted state or alongside their original fingerprinted version if transformative like news networks newspapers etc others like social networks can decide to limit the visibility of untagged content showing sensitive material if needed or to mark that accordingly.",

      "Ai regulation will always be made to favor the corporation that want to own the sector and place the innovation behind a paywall they will paint it like they are protecting artistsworkerscreators they care absolutely nothing about and use the new rules to create the feudal kind of control that modern corporations love so much imho the entire copyright law is written that way especially given that even if in theory a work of art belongs to the creator they just persuade you to cede your rights and then hold them forever they will crusade against open source models as much as they can although the cat is out of the bag and this is the internet so yeah to be honest i dont mind paying for a good tool but generally patentenforced lack of competition tends to make things worse for the consumer besides most regulators ar not tech savy so even those who are in good faith and not just on the payroll of big companies assuming they exist would probably struggle to write legistlature that cant be abused to create a monopoly they wont even need stringent rules itd be enough to leave them ambiguous and then deploy their armies of lawyers to kill off competitors through legal costs and lenghty proceedings unfortunately unless some of us has massive influence on congress which i doubt there is little we can do to prevent this maybe this specific instance wont be implemented but they will try again besides id love to see what happens when tribunals figure out that ai illustrations are now in the training data of supposed proprietary models given that stock art libraries are now full of those and my bet is that not all of those are based on fully proprietary training data themselves.",

      "Based off that the we arent using your files gang can now be legally told to suck its own æss that is some nice progress already good luck proving that this technology is not designed to harm the creatives working with any medium that got hoarded by ai now that pretty much every court hearing from now on can use miss openais cto own speech as an evidence her team aimed to scrape human work before killing off susceptible human job openings.",
      "As far as im aware you dont actually have a right to privacy in a public space in the uk at least as crazy as it sounds you can indeed walk up to someone and take a photo and there nothing they can do their image is being captured hundreds of times by cctv anyway were basically at the point where you imply consent to be photographed just by leaving the house everything i mentioned is just out of courtesy publication rightscopyright doesnt come into it if you want to sell the image to a stock photo library they will ask for a release form from the subject including recognisable buildings but your personal insta should be fine.",

      "Heres one secret hard patient work i feel like i have been on both sides of this issue obviously we all start out at some point i was fortunate to have and i would like to think earn two internships after securing a degree both were incredibly helpful but i would say neither were a mentor relationship in turn i have had interns on a short term basis one transforming into a freelance assistant relationship additionally i have had numerous ongoing freelance assistant relationships along the way i have certainly been hit up for questions and advice i have hosted both paid and nonpaid workshops and even invited photographers to my studio to use my production resources in the past i have generally been receptive to those kind of interactions but i had one situation that blew up in a dramatic fashion that has caused me to pull back from interacting w photographers at different levels unless i know a lot more about them than a cold inquiry you post reads to me as very onesided as in literally expecting something for nothing i doubt that you have exhausted all available online tutorials it strikes me as asking someone to leapfrog you ahead in your career to the benefit of no one other than you have you had professional portfolio critiques have you joined professional organization like asmp have you taken professional level workshop ive spent many many hours trying to study but if ive learnt anything it really is about who you know that is a very lazy excuse i certainly can trace the history of my career as being half front door and half sidedoor but it is inaccurate to think that contact or sidedoor projects and opportunities didnt come originally from either cold inquiries or developing a network of clients by fostering and maintaining relationships from lowlevel projects and personnel as they grow in their career you are asking to cut in line without working for it imo why is it that you think that big photographers didnt achieve their position through equal amount of inspiration perspiration and persistence.",

      "Ok started off as a computer science student in the s years as a multimedia designe modeller took a break to become a humanities academic and am now doing traditional art and sculpture i studied graphics and ai at uni and didnt think i would see image generation like sd in my lifetime so the biggest word to pay attention to in your question is concept a concept artists job is to flesh out an idea into a visual format to then be used by manufacturers finished artists modellers etc so its about exploring forms to find one that meets the requirements of the client such as some kind of beast that lives on a snow world or an animated character for a toilet paper commercial either way you need to produce something that makes sense in the final version either a believable creature or as an effective brand rep for the creature you would need an understanding of body kinematics how animals move you might want to invent sexes a lifecycle consider what they eat what threatens them how long they live all of this will make your design more and more believable for the character you might need to know brand colours the psychology of advertising the history of animated advertising characters what sorts of looks encourage memorization and anything else that will help make a cartoon sell toilet paper soall of that and not a single mention of the process of actual artistic visualisation these ai tools have a great ability to give an impressively rendered image based on a limited amount of text and image input but they are also dumber than a box of hair it isnt able to understand any of what its doing so wouldnt be able to create something by itself so its limited by the skill of the prompt writer even then the prompt writer must also do all the prep work i described above if they are going to get sd to create an actually viable concept to move forward with concept art isnt in any danger that i can see although who knows with models like gpt at the moment the real threatened industried seem to be things like corporate art pulp book covers stock photography things where there is almost no concept involved at all so someone from middle management feels like they have what it takes to do all the art for their next advertisement learn the fundamentals of art and design and start getting an idea of which area of concept design you want to get into and then start learning about the science biology sociology history and philosophy of that field pretty pictures is only a small part of it.",
      "I dont like giving out rates and tying yourself down like that not everything revolves around an hourly rate there can be additional things on top with a project my quotes are tailored to that specific project i may do a rough figure of an hourly rate to help form the overall figure but i dont present myself to work on hourly rates if they want a breakdown of the invoice then i give them that list the various stages within the design process data gathering meetings research including competitor analysis industry landscape analysis concept development etc i know youre just doing a poster dont dont let that limit yourself and be led by bad practises to start with also a trap newer freelancers fall into is billing only for the design time and forgetting things like meetings and research all the initial drawings and ideas and concept generation etc theres more to a design than you in adobe theres all the prep that goes into it as well even for a poster and set expectations especially with a friend on what theyre expecting a pdf a print ready pdf with crop and bleeds the source file itself i cant tell you what to price yourself i mean im in the uk as well so no idea about prices in the us let alone by state but also the quality of work you put out i dont care if youre junior if youre able to put out quality work like a senior then get paid like a senior sorry my comment hasnt helped in terms of a figure i dont feel like i have a valid opinion on that but just wanted to make sure youre thinking of everything to save you hassle later and set in good practises now.",

      "Tldr machine learning is not ai but ai uses machine learning ehhhh yes and no machine learning takes statistics and provides insightsoptimizations algorithms to achieve the same statistics or better at least thats the hope machine learning is not ai even if it is an automated systemsetup its more about the general populations understanding of machine learning most people dont get it so they just refer to it as ai with that said ai has machine learning capabilities otherwise it wouldnt have a reference source statistics to start with.",
      "That is an incredibly reductive oversimplification of human physiology our network extends to our sensory organs our nervous system our gut bacteria whole ecosystems in and on our skin and so many more ecosystems within ecosystems that would take all day to list out we may never scientifically understand the full picture of what we are and i have very high hopes for what science is capable of compared to a neural network on a computer we are talking a different kind of network entirely and uncountable quintillions of times more complex i make no attempt to predict what may be possible in the future humans do regularly create sentient life otherwise known as babies so its certainly within the realm of possibilities im just saying that there is no rational justification for mistaking a modern language model for any kind of life at all it might be fun to act as if they actually have a mind behind the conversation but its not good practice for anything other than being scammed it is important to set ones morals based on the reality we actually live in not the one that feels good to makebelieve it doesnt hurt anybody to be courteous towards a fictional character but its not useful either i really hope this extraordinary impulse towards empathy of yours extends to actual living things as well.",
      "Yes thats my plan feed bad data to the ai.",
      "Just like humans the difference is that you have millions of times more neurons in a structure proven by natural selection over billions of years and had access to much more content throughout your life than a newly created ai with all this you can abstract and mix content so well that you might even believe you created it yourself from scratch but no you cant even dream of a face youve never seen or describe a color youve never seen the origin of art is nature.",
      "In your second example isnt it just like human google knows all of that information but our kids and students still come to ask us precisely because we can organize and deliver it far better how does one even define knowing im sure it is still inferior to us in some way and as someone with some very little background in machine learning i do agree it doesnt truly work the way our brain does that said at this point if we look at the end results alone it is most certainly better than human at many things and quite close to us in the few areas it hasnt caught up yet just a little thought experiment and only slightly relevant to the point but imagine one day you see this seemingly normal guy on the road the catch is that this guy secretly has exponentially more information in his head than anyone on the planet ever has and can access that library of information for any trivial you ask of him in the matter of seconds now do you think our friend here would have the same kind of common sense and personal values we have or would he behave more like gpt in our eyes.",
      "We dont know whats going on under our own hood either see split brain patients and confabulation or the understood unreliability of eyewitness we know exactly how artificial neural networks work what youre referring to is the inability to check or understand why the llm said what it did we dont know why a human has said what they have in this very same way why were you mean to me because youre an ahole thats not true is the exact same or have you never been wrong because youve misremembered something also more training data most definitely does lead to diminishing returns i would recommend looking into what motivates us to do the things we do in the context of being biological creatures before looking into consciousness every single thing we do has been programmed into us over eons and we are the way we are because it was good enough to see us live long enough until we screw im not aware of complex theory but i can guess that it posits that consciousness is an emergent amalgamation of processes which is probably pretty close the main points of consciousness in my opinion are the temporal juxtaposition of abstract information which creates an environment beneficial to a perception of continuity.",
      "Both these are interesting discussions but i think they might be missing the importance of feedbackiteration in the process for the first specifically more is not better unless there is reason to believe a processstructural change this argument conveniently ignores that google has a huge data set of search correlations that did not spontaneously develop llm capabilities just because it was a bigger statistical system a transformer is not simply a bigger convolutional net for the second a trivial appeal to the state space in chess as a counter argument isnt compelling because its selling stats short anova correlates can be amazing even simple marketing stats can identify pregnant customers before they realize they are pregnant based on buying patterns this is pure stats respect it dont underestimate it more interesting is attempting to place bounds on the type of computational process that is something you can do from the outside but imho its much more definitive to show it from the inside the single pass through an llm is mostly just stats but word compression training and conversational state are more like iterations it would be interesting to treat llms as a kind of ifs even if we did this we might not learn much from the math side the math is one thing but the expression of iterated structures is another even the ifs folk might shudder at a geographical catalog of fractal structure within the mandelbrot set at least it would make one helluva coffee table book.",
      "Intelligence does not equal sentience or consciousness that may evade you but only because you are a fool your hubris is such that you imagine all to be possible for humans was pygmalians statue a slave is chatgpt like frankensteins monster ie an actually sentient but ultimately fantastic creation of humans the answer to those questions is no intelligence is essentially the understanding and application of logic physics ethics and their intersections none of that entails sentience a superintelligence would achieve that understanding and applicative capacity to a far greater degree of mastery than any prior human sentience without ever being itself sentient personhood is granted to sentient beings alone you just want the ai to be treated as sentient whether or not it is likely because of nerd fantasies edit as a note after reading all your gusto for guaranteeing the dignity of ai while we are their caretakers i just hope that you are a vegan or else your hypocrisy would attain levels most comical.",
      "No people pay me for explaining things like this i dont work for free dalle doesnt use any type of photobashing its stochastic by the pixel its easy to prevent training data from appearing in results im not debating im just letting you know your understanding is either incorrect or limited no offense meant.",
      "I hear what your saying but i worry that theres some moving goalpost here just because the mechanism is different doesnt necessarily mean that theres no understanding whenif agi happens itll like work very differently from us but that doesnt mean it doesnt understand things theres clearly some internal representation of concepts in gpt microsofts paper sparks of agi makes a great case for this for instance telling the model to iteratively explore a fictional house via text prompts then drawing a map of the house this demonstrates some representation of physical space or stacking problems illustrates the concept of balance and physical objects is this not understanding is this just semantics."

      "Honestly its probably because stable diffusion is limited in its composition abilities so portraits are the only thing it does well doesnt help that some of the models are overfit to the point where typing blue gives you a blue haired anime girl i find the dalle community is the best when it comes to being creative because the model cant generate accurate depictions of famous people but it listens to the prompt really well so people throw their crazy ideas at it instead of trying to generate pretty but bland images.",
      "All good took eight minutes to make the stuff i see coming out of kling and sora does that the ai models have a really good sense of world physics and automatically put that sort of detail in.",
      "Harpa ai is great any recommendation of something similar but for mobile.",
      "Mostly its for comfort of some extra features the standard stuff doesnt have quality some consideration but really its more of a wanting the nicer model.",
      "I kinda see this as the death rattle of this design style which is a bummer because it really does accurately express a sense of loss of control that people feel right now but hey bottle that feeling and sell it ima right.",
      "Two things first just generally updated training data so i dont have to use web browser mode every time i want something past and image and d model generation ability would be really useful.",
      "It recognizes a limited range yes obviously its trained on a finite dataset which was collected at some point in the past so never completely up to date plus in order to learn a style it has to see enough properly labeled images to form a concept plus if the artist has used a lot of different styles over their career almost all of them evolve then mjs concept of that style might differ from how you think of it having said that v with default settings is particularly bad at reproducing art styles because its own particular style tends to override them you can counteract this by using style raw and a low stylize value like or try version you can also experiment with the settings of other aesthetic parameters like weird and chaos and you can always try using an example image in an image prompt.",
      "Whatever the reason either they develop a solution to bots that doesnt involve simrelated phone numbers or anything that can be connected to specific people or information or ill just not use it even if its not entirely a problem yet it definitely will be especially as more and more is interconnected and we already see cases of overreach i think its just good to get in the habit now ive already long thought digital ecosystems were a bad thing and try to keep things spread out as much as possible and never give relevant personal info eg name address birthday etc for anything trivial submit your id to a singular service and have a unique key given to you to certify youre human then you wouldnt wan na submit your id would you thatd definitely be worse ive heard people tout that kind of stuff relating to nfc as if its a good thing i dont know why anyone supports it i know weve long been given barcodes at birth via social security numbers but going full dystopian future isnt desirable solve a series of captchas bots are growing to be able to solve captchas and would only make the sign up process more confusing for less tech savvy crowds that seems more pick and choose id say sacrifice the less savvy for better personal protections again this is just free beta ai software i just want to play in the sandbox.",
      "Doesnt make too much sense to me a checkpoint wouldnt use less compute for inference but it would if the architecture for the new model is more efficient.",
      "Now i am even more convinced that sd will be something like an improved version of deepfloydifideogram because it shows comparable performance in their tests and even requires the same gb of vram i hope they will optimise it the only differences might be that sd will have other smaller versions of the model slightly better text handling and it will be a bit better at dealing with color and object placement positions so if one wants to test sd largest model right now they can just test ideogram more thoroughly lol the impressions will probably be similar just my guess."

      "Thats the positive hope it becomes a tool for artists andor they create art more original than ai can the negative possibility is that many artists give up and we see less original art and generated art pulls from a limited set and becomes derivative we went through a round of this with photoshop type tools and digital art in general this is a different beast though.",
      "Different styles of art theres additional context youre neglecting with modern art where a lot of the impact is in the statement its trying to make thats not exactly true of ai art.",
      "The article quite literally doesnt add anything new to the table might as well be written by an ai ironically i think many ai artists are lazy spammers who cant inpaint or do some finishing touch on photoshop we dont even realize when real artists or talented people use ai for content because those are smart enough to use it as a tool whether its text or image generation the internet needs new filtering systems to separate ai content from aiassisted and organic content and no inference does not waste any unnecessary power its fractions of a penny per generation that myth is literally disinformation training does consume power but its not as bad as crypto mining not even close and training is very valuable academically.",
      "But laypeople can easily discern the difference between a bicycle and electric scooter whereas ai art and human art is close to indistinguishable.",
      "I have been using ai in my stuff for almost years now its just another toolset for me and i use everything most of my hand drawn stuff is mixed media i dont like limiting myself ai has made me better because i can produce concepts and ideas at an insane rate i can create concepts with images in the same amount of time that it can take me to create concept with image for me its all about output the labor of drawing only creates intrinsic value via meta data i am a hyper creative who has too many creative endeavors and no time to flesh them all out ai lets me bypass a lot of processes so that i may manifest more of my ideas with limited amount of time currently i am working on collections for prints designs for fabrics designs for clothing coloring books illustrated childrens books fivver services a tarot deck if there was enough time to draw every idea from scratch i would but i feel like the actual drawing work in all of these different endeavors was done when i spent years on and off drawing for hours and hours on end daily developing a multi layered outsider art style that i can truly call my own to which now i can just add my name to a prompt and it applies nuances from my style to every macro project i have mobilized now ai is pure fuel for a hyper creative generalist jack of all master of nothing like myself when harmonai drops ill then be able to apply ai to my music background of audio engineering multi instrumentalism songwriting and production when txtvideo drops i will be able to apply ai to my background of comedy writing and animationcartoons so i can fully expand on the cartoon show i started making years ago a new community for aitraddigi artists.",

      "I mean i can say the same thing about photography i could take photographs all day long i just have to press a button and maybe use a click to put a preset on it but is it really art nor the kind of photographs that ends up winning those awards the only difference is that the results you get while doing the bare minimum looks better i am just saying that creating art and expressing himself is something wonderful that deserves a bit of recognition and this no matter what medium is used im just trying to not give ai art the photography treatment of this is for someone who dont want to bother learning how to paint lets just recognize that every medium and more everyone is legitimate to create art using whaterver he wants lets take this post for example should the message and emotion of the artist be donwplayed because it uses ai instead of collage of photoshop and btw i think it takes a bit more artistic process than just entering a text prompt.",
