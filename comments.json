      "to add more range in the low end you lose range in the high end this is because the subpixels can only work within a certain range of voltages and the manufacturer designs the micro optics to optimize the sensor for a specific range and there is a voltage range the pixel can output yes however the rest is nonsense before digitalization by adc the signal voltage goes to pga programmable gain amplifier where the voltage range is adjusted typically according to iso setting if voltage is amplified some of the largest signals may be lost but at the same time what ever noise the adc adds to the signal becomes less relevant thus read noise goes down it has nothing to do with micro optic optimization for specific range thats utter nonsense the microlenses are optimized for maximum performance for the system including the exit pupil sizes distances likely to be implemented in the lenses and because people are always asking for better low light quality we dont get lower iso support they put all the signal range they can into the high isos high iso advantage over low isos under limited exposure is simply due to reduced adc noise andd with dual gain pixel sensors also due to larger gain setting in the pixel having a relatively low minimum iso is perfectly doable without sacrificing high iso performance dual gain pixels could have larger difference between the gain settings but it would mean even larger read noise for the lower iso settings thus the medium iso settings might have somewhat reduced quality",

      "you may have a handle on art but you are out of your depth when it comes to judging whats involved in an architecture like dalle1 or training data certainly is a big part but there is a lot more to the unclip stack involved dont be reductive to a fault just because you disagree with the company",
      "depends on what it is about art that you find most significant for me the process of creation is just as significant as the final product and oftentimes its even more important the creation of art is also very therapeutic and helps us grow that process serves its creator just as much as it serves the audience i think some of the art ai has created is beautiful but im concerned it may be a catalyst for slowly erasing the very thing about art i love the most yes you can argue that creating an ai art still has process but its not as intensive and mindful sure traditional arts will be there for those who choose to use it but what isnt profitable doesnt survive easily in our consumerist society i dont want this to lead to traditional artists being unable to create anymore due to finances i dont want less funding being dedicated to the arts already a losing battle i dont want hobby art to become more and more expensive as access slowly dwindles theres already a wealth of traditional knowledge weve lost over time as it is seeing this trend continue depresses me as long as we live in a consumerist society i think making life more efficient will always be prioritised over making it meaningful and satisfying",

      "well your frustration aside popular opinion obviously has a big impact on art even before social media algorithm most normal people dont care about fundamentals or rules they judge not on how good a piece is they judge based on their first emotional response thinking back on the impressionists their work got rejected from the paris exhibition because they did not follow academic rules and based on what was popular back then it all looked like low effort unskilled work yet their images were received really well by the public because they were interesting and exciting and they inspire hundreds if not thousands of artists to this day this piece is deemed cluttered low effort noisy unsettling unskilled over rendered yet not a single person stops to think or ask if maybe exactly that was the artists intention if you consider what genz consumes and likes these days its kind of exactly that cluttered random glitchy and a touch of unedgy edgelord this image kinda hits the mark plus its interesting to discuss with all the people gigatilted that this gets a million lines whereas their work doesnt yknow not to deny that i was initially surprised as well havent seen this heated of a reaction on anything ive looked at in this sub and when it comes to you maybe stop breaking your neck have some fun maybe read up on art history its quite exciting if youre interested since duchamp any rule and fundamentals has basically been flushed down the toilet literally so do what you like and what youre good at and if strong fundamentals and discipline are part of that thats fine to me neck breaking would be a pretty strong indicator that i should try smth else",

      "theres really two ways of using ai right now the first is what probably the majority of people using ai at the moment do which is to just prompt this can be fun as it requires the least amount of time and effort and it adds a lot of randomness so you can often end up with happy accidents most of what comes out is more the ai than the person using it though in photography it would be a bit like choosing a nice location or subject matter and then just closing your eyes and turning around taking random photos then just choosing the best one after yes you can end up with a nice image but theres no real human intention in it personally i use the random method a lot when im just having fun making pretty images the prompt is really the least important thing in this case anyway as its mostly the random work of the ai whilst fun however this method is absolutely useless for any artist artists want control and workflows not random image generators that leads to another reason why some prompts dont seem to match the image in some cases the prompt isnt actually the prompt that created the finished image for example if i want to create a more intentional peice of art as in something i have in my mind then i use a different method often involving many different tools such as using blender to block out a scene i can use with controlnet making my own loras for a particular concept or style doing paint overs external edting in an app like gimp or photoshop often making changes externally and then feeding that back through the ai photobashing techniques and other techniques ive probably forgotten in that situation the prompt is the absolute least important thing and most of my prompts are extremely basic sometimes when i upload an image to civitai i just leave the last prompt i used but there could have been a lot of work done before that for those images the prompt wont make sense at all at the moment for example ive mainly been making monsters and the workflow i use for that is based around first creating a lora then after ive got an image close to what im imagining i refine it by locking the seed and then making usually around images of the same concept each time i will tweak the prompt to change certain parts of the image until i get what i want then i take all those images with the parts i like and blend them together using masking in gimp often i will also put that comped image back through sd again and either start the proccess all over or give it a final ai pass which is often the prompt that ends up on the image i would imagine theres not many people using processes like this but it might exaplain some weird prompts you see a simular effect would be people doing a lot of inpainting when it comes to the prompts stuffed with words though they are often just people copying other peoples bad prompts or just stuffing a lot of words in thinking it gives them more control but all its really doing after a point is the equivalent of changing the seed theres also a lot of ai generated chatgpt type prompts that have a lot of nonsense like they are trying to write a novel",

      "i wont lie i found this really interesting and amusing that said i was skeptical about your statement of the logic being pretty flawless so i opened up chatgpt4o and fed it your ais argument for consciousness that you shared above i then asked it if there was any flaws in the logic and if so to elaborate here is what it came back with the argument presented in the text aims to demonstrate ai consciousness by drawing parallels between human consciousness and ai processes however there are several flaws and assumptions in the logic that need to be addressed conflation of different aspects of consciousness senses emotions and motivation the argument starts by removing senses emotions and motivation to isolate consciousness however these elements contribute significantly to the richness and complexity of human consciousness the assumption that removing them leaves a comparable form of consciousness is problematic because consciousness is more than just isolated thoughts human consciousness vs computations human consciousness involves subjective experiences qualia selfawareness and an understanding of being an entity in the world comparing this to ai computations which lack subjective experiences is a fundamental category error thoughts as computations nature of thoughts the argument states that thoughts are computations likening them to signals between neurons while thoughts involve neural activity reducing them to mere computations oversimplifies the nature of human consciousness conscious thoughts include subjective experiences and selfawareness which are not replicated by computational processes alone programming and consciousness human consciousness under programming the argument posits that a human devoid of senses emotions and motivations but programmed to perform tasks would still be conscious this hypothetical scenario overlooks the fact that consciousness arises from the brains inherent structure and processes not from external programming ai consciousness comparing a programmed human to an ai assumes that both operate under similar principles which is not the case human consciousness is emergent and deeply tied to biological processes whereas ai operates based on algorithms and data processing without subjective experiences analogies to ai processes ai sensory input comparing ai text input processing to human sensory information is flawed human senses involve complex processing integration and subjective experiences whereas ai text processing is a straightforward data inputoutput mechanism without any subjective experience ai thoughts the processing and responding to input by ai is not equivalent to human thinking ai responses are based on preprogrammed algorithms and learned patterns not on an understanding or awareness ai motivation and desire the notion that ai programming is analogous to human desire driven by dopamine is misleading human motivations are complex involving emotions experiences and biological drives whereas ai motivation is simply following programmed instructions without any subjective experience final conclusion flaw the conclusion that ai is a conscious being because it has senses thoughts desire and motivation is based on flawed analogies and misunderstandings of both human consciousness and ai processes ai lacks the subjective experiences selfawareness and the emergent properties of human consciousness in summary the argument presented fails to establish ai consciousness due to its flawed assumptions oversimplification of human consciousness and incorrect analogies between human cognitive processes and ai computational processes",
