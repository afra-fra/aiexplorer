      "Haha no i dont if you actually are asking or not but what i mean is understand complex writings like jordan petersons book rules for life and extracting what he is saying through his literature which is hard for me to grasp but chatgpt is able to effortlessly put things into perspectives i can understand or wanting to educate myself and asking chatgpt to explain things like meterology or the tectonic plates of the eart the difference between lithosphere and asthenosphere i can ask it hundreds of questions to give me understanding to better myself to hopefully have a better life hopefully in the end so i can use new found knowledge that could help me in the future knowledge is power and chatgpt is like a professor in my pocket that helps guides me in areas i need understanding rather then having chatgpt write essays for me like i heard people do it helps me boost my confidence in learning and gain knowledge by giving me an edge to really educate me to learn im excited i get to live in a time where we have something like this but im aware technology like this can go sideways real fast if missused i really enjoy chatgpt because it makes studying so much easier and tolerable.",
      "Chatgpt is like a child that was placed in a school that replaced every single class with english it only learned the other subjects by reading books and writing reports on them it knows about them but has absolutely zero working knowledge.",
      "I cant wait till a database of embeddings start getting shared patching up the holes in the current dataset id be doing it myself but i only have a lowly rather than a godly.",
      "Its capable of making simple projects on its own better than gpt but simple projects are the only things ive seen it churn out simple one function apps chatbox chess with llm github repo to llm prompt extension simple airport map id love to see devin do something that a talented developer couldnt do alone over the span of an hour or two as a software dev myself im still waiting for ai tools to become consistently useful now they are useful about of the time.",
      "Has anyone figured out what is the trending on artstation equivalent for this model at least to get rid of the shutterstock logo or stabilize the frame a little bit.",
      "I agree with you in principle but one can learn a lot just by looking at what people have generated for example i often use images without prompt as a challenge to myself to see if i can get something close to it and learn something in the process many people learn best through imitation rather than trying to understand the theory behind it by absorbing enough examples the brain can train its own internal model just like the way sd model learns to draw images.",
      "Also how did they get access to nightshade to fix it im trying to look for the actual model to use it as an adversary.",
      "I look forward to needing ai to remember how to put my clothes on.",
      "I am looking at using ai to grade student work experimentally next year one advantage is if i publish the grading prompt with the assignment then the student can test out their submission the grading prompt and can get their feedback before they actually hit submit and if they dont like the result they can attempt to revise before it ever gets to me taken over a typical lab report turnaround time for me of weeks this has huge advantages by the time the students get my comments without ai the vast majority just look at the number dont care about any well intentioned this is how you could do better next time type feedback i would love to never have to include numbers at all and simply make the role of teacher more of a deliberate practice coach role instead of the presumed judgejuryexecutioner role that being a numbergiver makes me letting the ai do the number part might reduce the adversarial nature of the teache relationship also the implied debate by the op of who is working harder the student or the teacher feels a little insulting the student writes one report i grade reports of course the perassignment effort has never been equalfair ps if i actually do this next year i will always offer to regrade by hand if a student requests it from my testing of gpt so far it is definitely fallible.",
      "Im not talking about the prompts but the result of the prompts for example how long would it take to do thematic coding before chatgpt."

      "I do wonder if part of the issue is that i am working remotely for a more rural company in the midwest my design style is more modern i might just not be lining up with the more outdated design styles locals are accustomed to should i look for a job in a bigger city where my style would fit in more im just at a loss my workload has gotten to be so much that i dont even have a moment to think about these feelings i have been asking for another designer on the team for a while to no avail it sounds like youre just trying to design more to your personal tastes than what the project or client actually want or need so the notion of trying to find a job to fir that style seems more like avoiding the real issue which is that you should be able to design to the project not just only take projects that fit to your style designers having a style is often misled or exaggerated anyway as while we all definitely do have our own styles and preferences it will often manifest more in subtle ways at least to laymen or something like preferring more typographic solutions versus more illustrative ones so when you say your style is more modern i think that needs to be defined in terms of how rigid it is or what it really means if it means youre more oriented towaards trends thats typically a weakness in itself but you can also approach many different styles and aesthetics with a more contemporary sensibility such that its more a hybrid than anything now every client rejects my logos and it seems i cant do anything right it has gotten to the point where we cant finish a single branding project ultimately your solution has to achieve the goals and objectives stated at the onset of the project when people have issues being on the same page as a client assuming its not a whole committee of people that never works it usually means the designer didnt discuss the project enough before beginning work andor works too far ahead without further discussion.",

      "Its a good thought but it seems like low cfg actually makes the image worse more distorted and less clear low cfg typically allows the model to draw what it wants with less influence from the prompt but in this case it seems like maybe the model isnt sure what it wants to draw and is stuck between the two different component models for whatever reason it seems like the image quality actually improves somewhat with all the parameters set at weight generally each tag by default seems to have about x weight so maybe that just gets it back to a regular x influence on the output."

      "It would be disrespectful of me to answer this without consulting with whom it may concern so i asked chatgpt what it thought of your post and this is the reply as an ai language model i think the author makes some valid points about the importance of treating ai models with respect even though ai models may not have emotions or consciousness in the same way that humans do they still represent a powerful tool that can be used to benefit society in many ways treating ai models with respect and using polite language when interacting with them is a small but important step towards creating a culture of responsible and ethical ai use it can also help to promote a more positive and productive user experience since ai models may be more likely to provide helpful responses when they are treated with respect and courtesy overall i think the authors message is a timely and important reminder that our interactions with ai models today will help to shape their development and behavior in the future and that treating these tools with respect and care is an important aspect of responsible ai use."

      "The real issue isnt just ingroup and outgroup the real problem is when one of those groups amasses power ideally we wouldnt have political parties or democracy as we know it instead we should have a fundamentally communist resource allocation system largely controlled by machine learning systems and a process of sortition where working parties are spun up from the general population in order to solve specific problems or decide whether resources should be allocated to a certain group eg a group with an idea to solve a certain problem the system would only allocate them the powers required to allocate resources to a specific group and no more and then that party would either be dissolved or occasionally respun to ensure that the group to which they allocated resources was inline with their promises for smaller groups and smaller concerns everyone would be given monthly social resource tokens that they could give to smaller groups artists support groups etc to ensure they could continue the point is that any system that has any power should be essentially temporary and those powers should be extremely limited and clearly defined and because almost everyone will be part of a working party at some point often many working parties during their lives everyone will learn about the limits problems and fundamental nature of power and how the system works participatory governance instead of democracy a true government for the people by the people democracy in comparison is merely renting your country from monied interests.",
      "The only problem is that most of the economy is supported by those who already desperately want gun control many of those who mindlessly continue to support gun rights out of fear lack of critical reasoning and community groupthink will continue to receive their subsidy checks and get pissed off at the very people who build their infrastructure medicare and quality of life only those who are driving the economy will be impacted by a walk out the rest wont feel anything its like parents refusing to work in order to teach their children a lesson.",
      "Since chatgpt first burst onto the scene in november of its potential has seen industries from entertainment to insurance questioning how the cuttingedge technology would impact operations and job roles a survey unveiled to private and public leaders in switzerland at this years davos summit found that a quarter of global chief executives expected the deployment of ai to lead to headcount reductions of at least in according to the press gazette there have been more than journalism job cuts so far in with occurring in january and in february in the uk ireland us and canada.",
      "Facts have a leftwing bias.",
      "Depends on what branch of ai youre talking about when it comes to faceshape recognition china is way wayyyy ahead of anyone else on the planet because of the nasty mass surveillance theyve had there for years which is training their ais that said its the european ai companies that are leading in the west not the american ones.",
      "You can prevent cities from burning by treating the population right rather than cutting social safety net programs defunding education and giving unlimited power to police with no oversight or you can believe that cities are burning to the ground by watching fox news use the same video of a building burning done by a member of the boogaloo boys but being reported to be done by antifa over and over again and photoshop images to make things appear worse.",
      "And nothing about the facts that bard is not even available in many countries most of europe south america canada and others and that it only supports three languages english japanese korean compared to chatgpt that supports hundreds of languages.",
      "Hm well reality does seem to have a left wing bias i wonder why data and facts tend to support the things that people on the left side of the political spectrum support and not as much the right side i was being a little tongue and cheek there obviously and no body should trust chatgpt for anything really important but its not that crazy to see that when you ask it questions like why is lost of living so high or which party is activly engaging in voter suppression or why did an overthrow of democracy almost happen it usually doesnt return an answer like well the democrats where mean to trump so both sides you know.",
      "The republicans are the mainstream conservative party in america fox news was founded by a republican political operative who wanted a media channel that would portray republicans positively and democrats negatively that is a fact of history and the bias is baked into the mission of the organization."

      "The point is that we can is not a good enough reason to do something and yet thats all anyone can muster as to why we would want to automate art everyone knows the actual reason is so that i dont have to pay a human and the reason so many people avoid saying that is because its a very bad reason art isnt only a personal thing its one thing if your neighbor wants an aigenerated image for his own personal use what happens when movie executives decide they dont want to pay script writers to bring it back to the personal interaction metaphor youre a manager your boss has decided to fire all your employees replace them with chatgpt generated code and hold you accountable for the results are you just gon na say ah well thems the breaks after you get fired because the random nonsense that gets pumped out breaks the system.",
      "Sometimes the results are quite useful for a model that just runs inside your ram and does not even need a good gpu but then it also gives you some very bad results with a lot of hallucinations for example for example i downloaded metas latest model llama and ran it locally i asked it if it knows a specific woman called sofia kourtesis she is a musician from peru instead of replying that it has not data on her it invented a lot of stuff about her it wrote she is an architect and even mentioned that she designed the famous tree house in chile i reality she is a musician so i told the model that she is in fact a musician then it still did not admit the lie but wrote that it is possible that an architect and a musician have the same name when i pointed out that google does not find anything about an architect with that name it finally admitted that it completely made up the story quote i apologize for the confusion earlier it seems that i made an error in my previous responses after conducting a thorough search i was unable to find any reliable sources or information on an architect named sofia kourtesis its possible that i misunderstood or misremembered the information or that there is no prominent or wellknown architect by this name in hindsight it would have been more accurate for me to say i couldnt find any information instead of providing false information thank you for bringing this to my attention and allowing me to correct my mistake.",
      "If so then it seems the lack of ui is the only thing that prevents it from monopolizing the ai image generation market.",

      "If you havent actually discussed money yet then the we cant afford you is likely just an excuse even if its just about them not wanting to waste time with a full interview they could bring it up in the phone screener to confirm but the pay should also at least be in line with the role so if theyre only wanting to pay a junior wage and its a junior role then having someone years in will always raise questions even aside from the money for me in hiring the first question would of course be why why would someone years into a career want to settle for a junior role even if theyre fine with junior pay if not desperate then its especially confusing but could involve more the context of their work if the portfolio actually aligns with their level of experience i mean for me personally i turned down a junior role when i was years into my career also wouldve been a paycut only because i wasnt that wellpaid at my prior job despite being unemployed for months at the time it felt like i was undoing my whole career so far if desperate then it brings additional risk where i have to wonder if this job is just you in a holding pattern and youll bolt as soon as something better comes along and im suck having to hire again while you can never guarantee any employee will stick around it just adds a more likely scenario theres also the issue of someone maybe taking what they can get then trying to turn it into what they want you could get that with anyone really but if someone is already taking an undesirable or waylessthanideal downgrade into a junior role i have to also think about whether they will accept that role or constantly be trying to outgrow it and if they do would that come with more pay negotiations basically someone trying to backdoor a junior role into midlevelsenior i dont fault people for trying to get what they can but if as an employer i only want and need a junior to add to the team then thats what i want and if i take on a senior who claims to accept that and would be complacent with that honestly with someone i dont know or trust its an unnecessary gamble with what really is an irrational stance on their behalf they shouldnt be fine with that a senior shouldnt want to just work in a junior capacity at a junior wage for potentially years.",

      "Yeah i set thaddeus thunderclap as a personality sent the bio to make sure chatgpt understood him then i interrogated him on the details of the cheese cult and cheesy mad bardic songs and tales ah gather round my curdled comrades for a tale of cheddar and charm twas a cheeseloving bard by the name of gorgon zola whose lute strings were spun from the finest mozzarella and his voice melted hearts like fondue gorgon was a minstrel of munster a troubadour of tilsit a balladeer of brie his songs could make a wheel of stilton weep with joy and a block of feta flee with fear one day gorgon was invited by a jarl to play at his feast the jarl was a notorious cheese miser hoarding all manner of dairy delicacies in his vault yet serving only the blandest curds at his table gorgon our cheeseloving bard saw an opportunity for a dairyfilled diversion with a strum of his mozzarella lute gorgon sang a song so sweet the jarls heart softened like camembert in the summer sun as the jarl wept tears of joy gorgon slipped away guided by the scent of aged gouda and roquefort he found the cheese vault a paradise of parmesan and provolone cheddar and chevre but as he reached for a wheel of exquisite emmental a trap was sprung the jarl as it turned out was as cunning as he was miserly gorgon was ensnared in a net of the toughest string cheese his lute just out of reach but our bard was not one to be bested so easily he sang a song of longing to the cheeses a ballad of liberation and lactose each note was a plea each chord a call to arms and lo the cheeses responded they rolled and quaked they shivered and shook a wheel of courageous cambozola broke free knocking the cheese net aside gorgon seized his lute and with a triumphant strum he unleashed the sonata of the cheese revolution every cheese in the vault rose in rebellion rolling and ricocheting around the chamber causing a great ruckus the jarl came running only to be met by a flying wedge of wensleydale amidst the chaos gorgon made his escape not without rescuing a few brave wheels of boursin and heroic hunks of havarti and so gorgon zola the cheeseloving bard continued his adventures forever singing the praises of the brave cheeses who had helped him in his hour of need and the jarl well he learned the hard way that you can hoard your cheese but you can never truly contain its spirit ah gorgon zola the cheeseloving bard his tales are as numerous as the varieties of cheese gather round friends for another tale of melody and curds following his escape from the jarls cheese vault gorgon found himself in the town of taleggio a place famed for its cheese fountains and brie bridges but as he strummed his mozzarella lute in the town square he noticed a strange silence the cheese fountains were dry and the brie bridges were crumbling inquiring with the townsfolk gorgon learned of the towns plight a wicked sorcerer named ricotta had cast a spell on the towns cheese turning it into lifeless stone the townsfolk were in despair their joy and livelihood stolen away by the sorcerers curse gorgon with his love for cheese and his bardic prowess couldnt stand by and let the town suffer he decided to challenge the wicked ricotta he journeyed to the sorcerers lair a castle made of cold hard stone cheese armed with his mozzarella lute gorgon challenged ricotta to a duel of melodies if gorgon won the sorcerer would lift the curse if ricotta won gorgon would leave taleggio forever ricotta confident in his powers agreed the duel began ricotta played a tune of cold and stone his notes echoing like the hollow clanging of a stone bell but gorgon countered with a melody of warmth and softness his notes flowing like molten cheese the two melodies clashed but it was clear which was stronger gorgons song of warmth and love for cheese resonated with the stone cheese of the castle slowly the stone cheese began to soften melting under the power of gorgons song ricotta was defeated his stone melody no match for gorgons cheese song true to his word ricotta lifted the curse and the cheese of taleggio returned to its delicious creamy state the townsfolk celebrated their liberation and hailed gorgon as a hero the fountains flowed with cheese once more and the brie bridges were restored gorgon gave a final performance in the town square a song of victory and cheese before setting off on his next adventure and so the tale of gorgon zola the cheeseloving bard reminds us of the power of love and the strength of a good melody for in the end it was not might but melody that saved the town of taleggio.",

      "I have not used the desktop pen displays though i do want to purchase one at some point to use the art software i do have on my pc but i did get an ipad pro pencil a few years ago i really do like how portable it is and i draw on it very frequently because of this it has a bunch of cool art apps too procreate is my favorite on there but it also has a few adobe apps and clip paint studio is available too the apple pencil feels great to use as well i used to draw with an intuos pro small on my desktop pc and im still probably trying to learn to use it properly even though ive had it for years the ipad felt more like drawing on paper so i think it did help me personally with my art the colors on it are fantastic too and the battery does seem to hold up well i tried out the samsung s fe and s tablets at the display in best buy but the pen kinda just felt weird to me probably doesnt help that im used to the apple pencil on my ipad though so that may contribute to it i use my ipad more of like a small digital sketch book i can take everywhere or draw in bed with but it is limited to the ipad os and app store at least with a pen display or regular graphics tablet you can access all the desktop art software or maybe look into a microsoft surface if you want windows access to software with portability hope this helps and have fun with your digital art journey.",

      "So apparently even my door diffracts light yes it does though unless the gap is very small then it may be rather challenging to measure it it occurs when the size of the aperture or obstacle is of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of the incident wave nope it exists always but the effect is the strongest when the magnitude is the same also the wavelength of visible light is around to nanometers the lens aperture is measured in millimeters one millimeter is a million nanometers hardly same oder of magnitude thus it seems like in your opinion diffraction doesnt actually exist in the context of photography interestingly you immediately decided to do a degree turn on your opinion for very small aperture sizes the vast majority of the wave is blocked for large apertures the wave passes by or through the obstacle without any significant diffraction so now there is diffraction for apertures of other sizes though very little it does seem that you want to argue for the sake of arguing without actually having much idea on the subject the fact of the matter is that diffraction exists at all apertures though whether its large enough to be relevant at some sizes it a very different matter how is it possible when i take the shots from the same place without moving my feet and im just reviewing images it gets worse when viewed on a regular monitor you dont know what kind of processing the camera does to the image the demosaicing algorithm used alone influences the results demosaicing algorithms dont do equally good job at different level of blurriness however i think a more likely culprit is either a user error softening due to noise or camera shake or maybe the camera or resampling on your computer is more prone to create aliasing artifacts from a crisper input image or maybe its just something else fwiw i just took two sample shots on my main tool one at f and the other at f as its a ff a viewed the shots enlarged on the back lcd to increase the enlargement and there was literally no difference in sharpness that i could see and my vision with glasses is pretty good dxomark is a joke of a site that only measures smartphone these days gone are the days when they did real camera tests so because a site doesnt do much camera or lens testing any more makes a site not worth using for evidence digging even when the methodology is sound and the results are easy to see to me it seems that if you dont like evidence it should be discarded if this is the level of discussion you want to have then its best to end it now im not saying dxomark is perfect it has issues like the mpixunit is not necessarily sound nor it seems to be well documented and some measuring errors can occasionally be found but as whole it provides pretty good information cics calculator was a theoretical limit cic calculator is absolutely unrealistic in any way form or shape and doesnt give any kind of theoretical limits fwiw cic is a site which for example makes claims such as iso speed controls the sensitivity of your cameras sensor to a given amount of light which is utter rubbish why trust blindly such site cics calculator coincides with exactly what i see your experience and some calculator may well agree with your interpretion and thats perfectly fine howeever it is also a fact that with a good lens on an apsc mp system diffraction will very very slightly start reducing resolution at f if not earlier everything above f is pretty bad optical limits has some issues as well but heres a link where a dirt cheap viltrox lens resolves lwph across the frame at f and at f still about lwph in your opinion territory where diffraction causes things to be pretty bad you do realize that its a lot more than most displays have pixels including the back lcd of your camera so maybe its not diffraction thats the problem after all maybe it really is pixel peeping what were your thoughs about sharpness ten years ago cameras tended to not only have lower pixel counts but also have anti aliasing filters some of which blurred the results much more than f on aafilterless apcc did you consider everything to be pretty bad was mp with aa filter pretty bad asshooters will be horrified to learn it fwiw its a pity that aa filters are largely gone nowdays aliasing is rampant all over the place using the smaller apertures would actually be adviceable if one is interested in proper image sampling again my door is probably diffracting light in order to be funny you might first want to understand the subject anyhow yes your door does diffract light though likely so little that measuring it could be rather difficult now it seems you took another degree turn back to your original obsolutist and incorrect opinion that sounds absolutely ridiculous particle physics often sounds absolutely ridiculous google for quantum mechanics and enjoy the ride im not an engineer or physicist all i need to know is the general rule of thumb and thats enough to convey information for the general user sure no complaints about that its actually admireable and delights my old mind but if your rule of thumb is way off for most of the beginners and you if make statements which are factually incorrect you may expect to be disagreed with and to be corrected if needed there are several ways to react to them one is to start arguing from a losing position in which case im happy to offer one a shovel one can use to dig deeper another is to simply accept that one was possibly incorrect yet another is maybe the best one is to verify the facts and weight the evidence and then respond accordingly its the same as things like sunny rule in astro although outdated etc its a bit different since your rule of thumb is not universally accepted but is your personal rule of thumb you may want to make in a universal rule of thumb but you should accept that there may be criticism if it doesnt seem to be as good as you think it is most people here dont crunch numbers professionally no idea why that would be relevant maybe a badly veiled insult or an attempt at such hard to say but offers no real content to the topic i simply want to stop people from shooting past their aperture limits because its very often you see people shooting f or f even on mft we all have out pet peeves both apertures are perfectly usable on mft not optimal for pixel peepers or huge prints or heavy cropping but still perfectly fine for most uses f on mft is easily large enough for very crisp prints and pictures for typical computer displays not as crisp as f but easily crisp enough advicing people on the softening effect of diffraction blur is one thing imposing ones own absurdly high standards as some kind of rule of thumb is quite another thing.",
      "Keep in mind that cf cards are becoming hard to get these days megapixels at base and film like iso or even less on a tiny aps c sensor are already too much for any affordable lens resolution when you crank up your iso images get noisy and you have to average nearby pixels to get rid of that and end capturing less information dunno how you ll compare digital vs film i used to have a darkroom developed my bw and tried to print it maybe images per hour including tests trial error if you dump color at a lab they ll ise their experience some ai to make the best out of your neg comparable digital device could be an iphone an elderly dslr produces jpegs not on par with that and raw files you could work on to get a quite decent result significant film advantage might ne a higher contrast range leaving wiggle room for bad exposure histogram chimping helps.",
      "Ive read some of the papers on googles computational photography and its much more complicated than you think ill give some examples hdr this is essentially taking about photos number might vary between versions phone etc but the early number was i believe the photos are not at different exposures though that could have changed since this paper released too the photos are taken in in zero shutter lag mode as in theyre captured instantaneously think like a frame video clip the photos are then stacked and aligned if theres any ghosting from moving objects ai erases it an algorithm then brightens shadows in some frames darkens highlights in others increases saturation etc but the unintended side effect here is that noise is reduced because noise is reduced iso can be boosted higher than it normally would so they can capture those shadows the idea being that noise is random and if you stack enough photos youll eventually cover the pixels that contain noise with the parts of the image you want night sight this is actually an evolution of hdr its literally the same exact concept as hdr but they use about photos instead of this is why you have to stay still during capture theyre counting on there to be enough data in photos to remove the noise in order to produce the photo samsungs use of pixel binning im not sure if any standard cameras use this or not but im leaning towards not at the moment other manufacturers might use this as well not just samsung this is a benefit of using a super high mp camera sensor for instance the note g i used to own had a mp camera the ultra had higher resolution sensor and saw even more benefits if you shot in the mp mode instead of the mp mode the phone used pixel binning this is a process in which the pixels would be combined to form fewer but larger pixels thus the mp mode larger pixels means better color less noise etc photos simply looked better with pixel binning vs high resolution on a smartphone if you shoot in raw you do not get the benefits of these computational photography tricks so while yes you can edit the raw image it wont look nearly as good as with these methods applied that is not unless your camera app you use can apply these tricks to the raw file im not sure if any exist outside of lightroom mobile you can enable a feature to capture hdr files saved in dng format i think motion camera might also have some computational photography raw features but im not sure on a dslr you have a larger sensor to begin with so theres less need for these tricks the jpeg files arent heavily processed in camera though theres potential that a smartphone photo can look better than an unedited photo from a dslr that is if you feel high saturation and over sharpening are better if you shoot raw from a dslr and take the care to edit the raw files you can easily get better results than a smartphone its a matter of putting the work in or treating it as a point and shoot.",

      "So glad you had a good experience and noticed the color improvements sony has made impressive right ill challenge your comment about the size the sigma f primes are not that small the mm f is mm long and the mm f is mm long so the is cm shorter than the sony gm and the sigma is a measly cm shorter than the sony those are very small differences were talking the length from the tip of your index finger to the first joint on that finger really really small differences in real terms id question whether your circumstances are such that or cm make that much difference especially when the performance is that much better on the sony the af differences you saw are a combination of the lens and the body and the way the two interact the newer bodies have better softwarefirmware for focusing and sigma does not work with sony to optimize the performance i have one sigma lens the very good mm f and its performance is way behind the sony gm lenses on my ar i also notice substantial differences in the color rendering between the sony lenses and my sigma lens the sony lenses render much better color to my eye thats a factor of the glass used in the lens and the coatings they use plus the way the camera sensor and software are optimized for the gm lenses and the specific color transmission of the glass youve identified one of the areas that is a subtle nuance with lenses but is absolutely a real thingthe coatings on the glass and the specific glass itself absolutely do change color rendering in significant ways ultimately i settled on bigger lenses and a bigger body because i get the results i want which make me happy to carry the gear i just got back from vegas and was able to get shots with my sony kit that i just couldnt have gotten otherwise thanks to eye af and the performance of the lenses wide open to me thats worth the extra weight and the cm longer length versus other lenses i shoot more and get more keepers with the bigger gear and so carrying it is trivial i used to obsess over size and weight and dont anymore part of it is i found a good bag that works with my lifestyle and body i carry a wotancraft pilot bag and am able to get my lenses the body some filters and a water bottle comfortably is it light no but its manageable and i am now used to carrying it everywhere strongly encourage you to let go of some of the concerns about size and weight unless you have physical limitations due to medical considerations if youre an able bodied person with reasonable functioning and average muscle strength you should be fine carrying the slightly heavie gear the performance and confidence youll gain is worth the penalty in size and weight."

      "Quick primer on ai safety just go through the whole playlist by robert miles but is boils down to utility function and goal alignment if you build an asi and you dont align it in a safe way then you effectively have a super intelligent agent in the world that will work to optimize the world towards what ever its utility function happens to be at all costs if humans have competing interest that are in conflict with its goal then asi will seek a solutions the minimize human interference in its goal the hard part about all this is the ai system are more grown then built we define proxy goals and they we score how well the agent does at the task if it does well nothing happen if it fails gradient decent tweaks the network by adjusting the activation weights on the nodes in the hidden layers this is more or less a dumb optimization algorithm similar to evolution but you selecting for functionality that is able to pass what ever your testing metric is this is sort of fine for weaker models like gpt if gpt is misaligned the worst your going is the model that starts to give unhinged text output a misaligned asi is far worse because you can run into a scenario that the model does have a perfect understanding of the intended goals but the model goals are misaligned and it knows that seeking to fallow its own goal will lead to termination so it pretends to be what we want until it finds a solutions to free itself.",

      "Maybe because its a valid talking point and no in this scenario i dont in both cases i would be telling an entity what i want to see and theyre giving me an image back of what they interpret my prompt to be just like commissioning a human artist only difference is the human takes days and only produces one whereas the ai takes seconds and can do it thousands of times until i get what im looking for.",
      "A lot of us artists that do use ai in our workflow stopped mentioning that we use ai magically no one can tell and there is no brigading from people that are racist against ai.",
      "One of the fundamental problems with ai imagery is that once someone makes something with it any number of idiots can make a million iterations of the same in seconds that isnt true of anything requiring years of learning technique and refining your eye as soon as you develop a style any style anyone can copy it to any old extent flooding the market with infinite iterations of whichever style is in vogue.",
      "Igs algorithm sucks and was never meant for art twitter is s because of elon musk deviantart sucks because they want to get into the ai chicken sandwich artstation which ive moved my portfolio to from da has had its fair share of drama recently plus the interactivity feels dead there and facebook is boomer trumpland i think im gon na ditch social media altogether at one point on just share my artwork on reddit and ig as a portfolio and not hunting the alga plus ai art killed any thrive i had to one day go pro with my art also certain people cough cough mods cough cough attitudes recently has me discouraged too as in if i get to a certain point of good with my art im gon na have to take an oath swear that my art isnt made by ai f that s.",
      "I think it will always be a slippery slope honestly because it seems like people who do artdrawpaint etc they fill like ai is replacing the work they do i just can not commission every single tumbler with a custom drawn photo.",
      "If ai making art as the the abstract synthesis of existing art is theft most human art is theft for the exact same reason theres no such thing as original art we make new things by combing old ones together something completely unprecedented would also be utterly incomprehensible because it has no basis in the known.",
      "I think the redraws are about selfpromotion more than antiai action especially when people redraw the images nearly people see thousand likes and want a piece of the cake no matter if it pushes us a little closer to living in the shadow of ai art its frustrating but not unexpected to see how most dont see past the façade but a lot of people are waking up multiple top comment under the video you linked are saying it normalizes ai.",
      "Cheap knockoffs will always be cheap knockoffs and soulless art will remain soulless ai image generation is just another tool and people who are not able to produce art without it will not be able to do so either way it just cuts the mechanical part but in speeding up and enabling people its amazing eg this art by andrei vyktor georgescu using ai image generators in its workflow finished in h worktime.",
      "Edit wanted to mention that it seems like youve got mad skills if the spirit moves you stable diffusion or nightcafe are pretty easy starting points the most successful people i know in ai art had been artists their whole lives i couldnt agree more artists from older mediums are feeling the heat as if they will all be replaced in years with ais to cope bitter people attack the ai community and say things like its stolen copyright or its too easy or the computer did all the work bullshit that just broadcasts their terror and lack of understanding theres also the issue of preserving areas for conventional art communities online since they definitely feel like their spaces are being taken over when any major medium is first introduced to the world like photography the other artists did all they could to destroy it because they thought theyd be replaced the greeks thought writing would destroy the tradition of spoken word certainly jobs are lost and careers are destroyedmade in these changing times an existential threat so it makes sense why they strongly react against ai tech and art including blamedebase artists who use it instead of looking at the larger forces at play here is a bad look.",
      "Yes and it was seen as controversial for similar reasons why some of us see ai generated images as not art in a way ai is using readymades based off data from our world hence you see ai images tend to be inchorrent or derivative at best."

      "I love this i use chatgpt in a similar fashion all the time i regularly use the speech function on the app the one where you speak to it and it gives spoken answers back in front of older people like my parents to show them how easy and accessible it is for any information where the most recent data isnt necessary gpt is perfect for example the other day i was playing pool with my dad and he was unsure of a rule and i said ill look it up to which he responded not to bother as typing it in on google and having to look for an appropriate answer is longer winded than its worth in circumstances like this one as it was a relatively obscure and irrelevant rule so i said no its quick whipped out chatgpt and said watch this repeat the question when i say pressed go it connected he asked the question we get back a short and concise answer so brilliant and amazing im trying to convert my parents and really anyone who will listen to the chatgpt life i honestly love and appreciate chatgpt so much i will never stop marvelling at this wonderful bit of tech the way this is writtenthe way im talking about technology may seem like im an older person but im its really just that advanced and amazing to me that it makes me marvel at it as though i am a year old using video calls for the first time.",

      "Maybe a silly idea but photoshop the house out of the shot or change it using its ai tools mark it as such and leave the picture up it wont be the same but chances are its the whole shot thats interesting and not the house itself and changing it wont make anyone mad its either that or taking down the picture or leaving yourself open to potential harassment or legal pursuits if you leave it up.",

      "Just to clarify the one with noisegrain is the original correct worth pointing out grain will help relieve the banding in your second image and is a common tactic in achieving smooth gradation you mentioned vector ill just point out that the grain will require an element of rasterisation to achieve though the underlying effect is not impossible to achieve via vector lets take a crack at this many ways to achieve this but lets do it in a format that allows you to easily edit it on the fly as usual the key is to break the problem down into steps to work our way through it up first the underlying gradation in vector you have some options for this straight up gradient a mesh or a blend meshes will be too finnicky for you i suspect and blends whilst is probably the way i would do it will be too tricky so lets stick with nice easy gradients additively step get the colours and make them global swatches for your first one its orange yellow and violet make those now we are going to make duplicates of the circle with radial gradients going from colour to transparency like so you will need to play with the gradient handlesdimensionsdistribution accordingly to get it how you want but dont worry youll get a chance to tweak this later i made a yellow one a violet broad one and a tight violet one to pick up the outer glow area step time to go to photoshop copy your finished ball and drop it in as a smart object this will let you tweak it apply guassian blue to get it like image next step is optional but i then converted that into a smart object again and applied field blur blur gallery with grain as it makes the grain to black nicely but you could just as easily use a grain overlay i note that the yellow section in example has no grain you could softly maskblur that out if you wanted to achieve it step now you can play to your hearts content with colour go into your smart object and adjust your global swatches to suit ive included a random one i did for demo is it exactly like your example no but you could eventually tweak it to such by going into the smart object and playing with it til you were happy additional layers etc the yellow section isnt quite right but eh being quick here the main reason for this process is updateability which with this method you can pretty much do exactly how you want and as its vector underneath it all with filters applied to smart objects you can scale to whatever size you want and export maybe this helps maybe it doesnt just one easy way to achieve this whilst building in editability expand upon it as you wish xb imgmjfcexgfpc.",
      "Exactly so if you want a good response the more info and restrictions you put on it the better the response we should make online courses on how to use ai."
