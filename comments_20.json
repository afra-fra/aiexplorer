      "tell them to keep an eye on fingers and eyes thankfully ai still has trouble with those and is a dead giveaway if you notice them warping",
      "dimension of every model 60x60mm printed with phrozen sonic mini 4k and creality white resin i use javascript and threejs because threejs has some functions to export 3d geometries to 3d printing files stl the algorithms to create the stairs are a mix of noisy paths curl noise and circle packing to detect collisions the towers are mainly trigonometry and polar equations this is an update of a previous post",
      "ai is left those ropes are full of errors",
      "there is even a cylinder model i have never seen one on the road not sure why it exists the newer ones also have cylinder models but just for china",
      "i made a ai generated text out of the caption with neuroflash this painting is a beautiful example of vermeers use of light and color the girls face is illuminated by a soft light and her pearl earring and sunglasses add a touch of mystery the background is a rich blue which makes the girl stand out even more this painting is simply stunning and its easy to see why it is one of vermeers most famous works",
      "i had a scribble pattern inside the flaps of a package design of course i snuck a penis in it",
      "i detect a pattern here dont do it if you do work for her draw up a contract",
      "first very cool dome i wish i could do that but mine is an oval x30 second i built a deck on one side of my pool over the railing years ago and have put liners on it since it looks like you left enough room to pull the liner tight and clip it as you are stretching it i dont think you will have any problems",
      "theory is that the latest weirdness is caused by chatgpt starting off the answer with a powerful model then finishing it off with a worse one when its on the right track in this case the model that took over just decided to go against the initial response",
      "definately agree with blending stump have you ever tried graphite powder this scale might be a bit small for it but with the right brush it might help",
      "thats pretty awesome did any of the training data have open mouth open mouth extended jaw",
      "there is a free asset in clip studio that paints the lineart based on the colors of your drawing search in the asset store by the content id just type the number on the search bar and install it maybe it will work for what you want",
      "you can use cotton buds instead as blending tools which work really well",
      "obviously ai the real panels would have little gaps for the holy spirit and all s",
      "clip studio on android is pretty good but subscription based infinite painter is a kind of procreate clone but also good for a one time fee sketchbook pro is a more natural painting drawing app it depends on how stuff feels for you and where you get the best flow from there are several more like ibis paint x it all depends on what you like they all do a decent job",
      "really impressive work the lighting is stunning and the model is very attractive one thing that strikes me is her left eye it somehow seems slightly off maybe the reflection in it owns little too subtle its not really an issue and it may just be me but my gaze fixates on it",
      "it was painstaking lots of parts were painted over and over and over i switched back and forth between blending the colors off the painting first and on the painting itself",
      "all raw means is that it stores a lot more data in the image taking photos as jpegs is fine you are just throwing away some detail to save a lot of space as a simplification think of it like instead of having shades of red itll compress that down to shades moving each red pixel that is being compressed closer to the next nearest shade so raw doesnt mean that it is better quality it just gives you more control over the final images exact look as you are editing it this can include preserving more of the dynamic range of the image but it doesnt necessarily mean it supports being shown on a hdr display any better",
      "ai you can see that emeaditly by lookimg for details like the pizza is not perfect matched up with the mouth and some other",
      "cool youre welcome fwiw blenders system requirements are about the same as photoshops its actually a very lightweight program depending on how you use it a bit of geometry like a hand model is nothing just like a few layers in photoshop is easy to process but then layers starts to become taxing but anyway i like your drawing style wish you the best"

      "my cents it absolutely makes no sense for public to defend the use of ml even if supplementary because of due dates its just like asking snacks to allowed being contaminated with lead because they cant pump it out fast enough to appiase the share holders its just asking someone to do something wrong to counter something wrong being done to them not only that but this is an ever accelerating circle the short time given to cretors to create their works is too short therefor they are pushed to cut corners by any means possible therefor short due dates become more and more normalized thu pushing creators to cut cornes ever incrisingly this is a selfeating snake",
      "man i know amazon asks if its ai when you put it up for legal reasons in case ai becomes illegal and they need to nuke all of it but they should also make it mandatory to have it be disclosed as ai in the description and as a tag the way it is now with with original art and touching prose this graphic novel brings being in the description is sooooooo misleading",
      "bc dalle has deemed fedoras as inferior as it should",
      "this is just one example the ability to quickly produce extremely large volumes of realistic diverse child abuse material would be extremely disruptive to current investigationprosecution work done in this space theres so many legal unknowns that havent been answered by tests cases and each countryjurisdiction would need to consider if their laws are written in a way that will cope with potential issues could someone use a defence that the material on their computer was all ai generated what if ai just generated one image unexpectedly who is personally responsible for creating the image and should their sentence be similar to that of someone who creates that material with a real child this is something that every that doesnt even touch on how a big part of that work is identifying the children in images contacting local teams to ensure their protection to have the internet suddenly flooded with images of children that may not exist would make this extremely challenging theres also unanswered societal questions could increased availability of this material make it more socially acceptable could that increase rates of actual child abuse in light of all of the above it seems like a nobrainer to limit its ability to generate explicitoffensive content why risk your product being banned in multiple countries",
      "all prompts raw generation just typed up cool cocacola commercial in an art museum and the ai did the rest s",
      "yeah because they dont want the model to draw csam is not wanting to get the authorities involved because your model draws cp woke",
      "but this is a very cheap trick dont they identify you by ip or some other data or they just dont care enough to stop you from doing this i will check this one out thanks",
      "duchamp and warhol is where your argument fails a random urinal a random can of soup both of which were designed by a designer and even have patents which is the whole point of the artworks why is a doopidoo image not taking info from a random portrait from a source like this person doesnt exist or from nonartistic photos is ai taking a whole chicken from photo a and cutting it out and placing it in an ai photo no it is learning what a chicken looks like it has feathers it has an eye here or there etc an ai image is drawing from a lot of sources and learning just like a human has and interpreting it into a new image if you just look at the different quality output you can see that some ai artists are at a much higher level than others so we can see that there is a lot of human influence in the final output",
      "somethings off about these picsand i cant tell what edit according tto the comments hereits aiso that answers it",
      "even still being outdated its runnable locally ive tried two of the more developed open source klingsoraluma clones locally and it takes gb vram for a second 720p whereas this looks a lot more consumergrade ready this is amazing how do you achieve such good consistencyno flickering it does suck that there is no open source music ai i really do wish someone would release it but beggars cant be choosers same thing with good tts still everything else being local hell yeah",
      "use blender to make 3d model you cant becouse ai didnt teach you shit ai can also be used to create 3d animation by the way i wrote a few tutorials on the subject if you are interested about learning more they are freely accessible and i wont try to stop you from creating anything after reading them"

      "here is a technical explanation intended for laypeople",
      "i tried using in that way and it tended to overcorrect and focus on adding flowery language could have been a problem with my prompt and is probably better at it so take that with a grain of salt that said there are enough alternative grammar checkers out there that i dont really see chatgpt as necessary for that niche",
      "still a valid answer chatgpt just has a gay headcannon going on",
      "there should be a model just focused on hands that you could toggle on inside other models just to focus on the hands its utterly absurd how weve figured out how to draw a trillion things in extreme detail but not hands and feet utterly absurd",
      "mj wasnt designed to do that it doesnt copy directly from a reference image just uses it as inspiration for colors composition and so on its a generative ai designed to make original images hope that wasnt condescending a lot of folks seem to expect it to have all kinds of image manipulation functions i see this kind of question asked multiple times a day so dont beat yourself up for not knowing",
      "i dont understand what this means but it sounds to me like the latent space the compressed image representation are in colors instead of the usual rgb its definitely not just downscaling though its an encoding of the image in a completely different way that represents some kind of information of the image yep i understand that and must have just explained it poorly though funnily enough the latents dont seem to be as complex as one might first expect its asked to predict what the corruption from step was i think the multiple resolution thing wasnt done in stable diffusion but in a previous similar model stable diffusion uses a unet which is what thats referring to i dont understand unets well so may have gotten it wrong i have absolutely zero idea what this means thats referring to embeddings from the clip text encoder",
      "thanks so it is the specific phrasing and how the word human is introduced in that sentence that makes it seem like chatgpt should wait for human to input data do you know if this issue has occurred in other contexts if i ask it something else where it needs to recite a line with doing something to a human ill try it later",
      "you did no such thing the model lies to you about how it works read about hallucinations and how llms work what is context and how it affects the model how the models are trained they are trained once and after they are released they do not change a yota the only variable is context of the current discussion and chatgpt memory which is attached to the context",
      "yeah never claimed it had to do anything with chatgpt but the question specifically was about hacking old games no need to be a dick fren",
      "what i hope is that we can eventually get education to the point where it doesnt matter if you can produce the content from your brain not just vocab words but wholeass programs but if you can understand it maybe for cs exams youd just have the kid explain for minutes in front of the class why their algorithm works they get the questions at home first to prep plus it helps the soft skills im curious about its application for novel writing",
      "i do believe a country ruled by ai would be better than a human one provided that its entirely pragmatic with as few biases as possible but we need agi for that",
      "why would they tell google that the articles are written by ai",
      "imo its impossible censorship just is totally against intelligence and creativity or as chatgpt in sydeny mode finished this sentence censorship stands in total opposition to the freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas i think in theory they could remove all controversial text from the training data not possible in practice to remove all but even then the llms will be able to produce controversial topics i just dont believe you can have both",
      "k q and r seem to deviate from the pattern",
      "we have just solved some hard problems and are moving to harder ones yeah but in the end solving language didnt really turn out to be that hard we just didnt have the data compute and a couple of algorithms also note that we mostly solved vision and language at the same time but vision is much much much older evolutionarily than language so in a strict sense id say that moravecs thesis has been disproven vision should have been much harder than language thats why i propose the looser thesis that one cannot rely on intuition to predict what problems are hard or easy because evolution can make hard problems seem easy",
      "to answer you first i need to know what is the difference between an expert poet and chatgpt for you or why you think they are the same",
      "its kind of perfect obviously chatgpt doesnt feel things the way humans do but it also clearly understand feelings how they feel to people their triggers and their purposes kind of amazing to have an intelligence that clearly has a very accurate understanding of them and how they would feel feeling structure our wants and desires and goals what structures chatgpts",
      "no hes far from it unless i can get you to do a salazzle in a forest camouflage pattern bucket hat",
      "so we agree on the premise thats good and because of your generalisation and bias is why other commenters asked you to prove your statement now if you dont understand what generalisation is and what bias is then i cant help with that"

      "mins during half the day almost the other half its not possible to do anything which sucks for someone that likes to experiment a lot and its not just about shittier quality embedding are way more convenient as they can be used with already trained models and can mix with now issues this is the main point that people would really enjoy so many people want to use the paper cut model or borderlands model with their custom face model an embedding would be perfect for this since merging models is so shitty and its inconvenient to train each custom model you make with paper cut images and borderlands image to make your self in different style when you can have multiple already trained embeddings you can use and im not so sure if its always shittier quality its just that people played a lot more with db and didnt give ti a chance me included now that im using it more i found that it can be pretty good for styles as the ones mentioned in the post they can be made into a model but why do that when you can have a way more useful embedding",
      "depends on what exactly is int8 or fp8 etc there are a lot of moving pieces and lots of different things that use different precision sd1 really need the model weights being trained to remain in fp32 even if you use say adamw8bit optimizer and automatic mixed precision fp16 as it does scaling on the values among a number of other tricks and fp16 is fine for inference only but ruins training if the actual weights during training are stored in fp16 8bit is fine for loras and such as theyre more nudging stuff around and again use some tricks to get the most dynamic range possible out of limited bits other tricks like moment and scale factors with unique values over blocks of weights assist",
      "this would be very useful i have been manually doing this but would love to check various checkpointsmodels but to get the best result you need to use trigger works with some like modelname style redshift style nvinkpunk mdjrnyv4 style etc it would be cool if like autoloading vae we could somehow have auto prepost fixing trigger words found this it might be possible to build a queue and use xy plot not tested yet",
      "im a noob at this are the pluses necessary when entering prompts",
      "it sounds like you might not have quite enough vram for the workflow you are attempting make sure you arent using an image bigger than 576x1024 and maybe try reducing the number of frames if a small image with only a few frames completes rendering in a reasonable amount of time you could try increasing the size and length of the until you discover the limits of your hardware",
      "theres a big difference between enormous voodoo negative prompts dont help and negative prompts dont do anything its obvious that negative prompting is hugely helpful anyone should be able to see that but the synonyms for ugly are just pointless",
      "i used to think that way too but theres an important distinction generative ai doesnt work with the original pixels or bits of data instead it creates new from scratch during training it gradually denoises a noisy image to match an example from the dataset and saves the learned parameters into its model weights when generating new picture it starts with a noisy image and denoises it according to the prompt and learnt parameters producing new image rather than just remixing existing data and dont get me wrong i dont justify training on copyrighted content there are just some misconceptions about how it works",
      "wahou what was you initial prompt to get this one which ai enhancer have you used",
      "hi there i have 13k rendered image pairs like this one this dataset could be used to generate better depthmaps for faces finetune midas perhaps one could generate realistical image with depth2img from the rendered ones and use these newly generated img original depthmap to train midas on headhair depthmap anyone wants to give it a shot",
      "with the option to extend i put prompts that maintain the artistic style for example in all the prompts i put detailed painting of and i am changing what i put after that depending on what i want to generate for example to make the sky above the shark i put a painting of the sky with seagulls detailed also to make it look good you have to select with the option i extend a part of what has already been generated because otherwise anything will come out",
      "wow thanks for the very detailed reply a huge help i have pretty much done what you describe in the beginning i have made a character in a specific realistic checkpoint not a base one by a combination of different loras however in my data set of this character there is no sexual or other theme like the list you have its simply the character nude in various positions front view profile back view close up full body etc i have images and only of them features some clothing i simply want to capture this character in a lora so i dont need to use the combination of different loras that make up the character currently so in this case should everything still be captioned and do you use adamw since you dont like prodigy or adafactor and finally those numbers you have before the epochs 5e4lr etc are they the learning rate and if so what do you mainly use in text encoder learning rate and unet learning rate",
      "the ratio of your image you are using 512x512 but his looks like 512x768 or something not sure about the external generator its just a a tag in the civitai webui",

      "the reason that people use a lot of these is because of anime checkpoints most anime checkpoints are based off of naianythingv3 those versions were trained using danbooru tags and thats why people use masterpiece best quality as these are quality tags on danbooru those two were not trained by picking a subset of the best images but rather they basically just scraped anything they could find because they thought more databetter model however that lowered the average quality of the model so using tags that denote the best images on danbooru in fact improve overall image quality however as people realize that better quality data is more important than the amount of data the average image generated by newer checkpoints has become far higher quality what that means is for the most part a lot of the newer anime models do not strictly need those tags though they do still improve the quality on some of the older ones anyway a lot of general stable diffusion checkpoints also adopted the danbooru method of prompting even if not necessarily trained on it in part due to the simple fact that thats what people are used to there are some tags that actually make a difference due to their concepts like ray tracing subsurface scattering bokeh etc these are generally not danbooru tags however with sdxl this has changed because the general quality of images used to train the base model has changed and people making new checkpoints usually only train on the best images though pony is an exception heres to praying that with sd3 we finally see the end of all of these prompt tags",

      "first of all the purpose of this post is to let all the experiment documented and to give some room so open source community may have some new ideas and carry on from here mind that my main field is finetune and train so bear with me please second im not the only one who has been doing this as i also personally talked withthibaudz and fictiverse so my workflow is different than them but at the same time we were pursuing the same my respects to everyone who is making something useful for the community thank you all ok to be honest i thought this was going to be way way easier than what in reality has been a nightmare for the ones who dont know whats magnificai in simple terms we could put it as upscaenhancer we all know some people accept upscale only as preserve the same image etc but we can refer for now to this term as your image but better to avoid enter in a useless war for names and concepts in a nutshell it makes the image way more powerful with more impact more realistic at some times or just ultra detailed your images but prettier right the purpose of the company imo is not to have the same image but bigger and detailed no that is easy to do and lets be honest anyone can do that with comfy or just webui what theyre doing is to have a different textures minor variations done realisticaltered etc everything that can make the image looks way better even different without exiting the range of the internal structure of the image and preserve somehow their integrity i think could be related to coarse layers will talk later about this at first it sounds easy as detail lora controlnet model ok go on try to go close to their textured leaves blocks ground facesskin very difficult to get that sort of texturing or their insanely detailed micro details its harder than it seems and trust me cause i was one of those who think this was very easy no its not or maybe im unskilled enough in this task at first glance you can see that theyre just using or could be using xl custom some sort of tiling upscaling cause in some you could see the tiles and control the influence via lora and thats all reality is that even with controlnets it seems super hard to aka what they do alter the image with some super detailed internallydifferent textured structures without destroying the original structure of the image what i mean with this think of this like a clipping mask effect in photoshop some images changes a lot to the point the details barely visible got pushed but not the original structure lets take a look at some original examples to illustrate what i mean with this and that differs from normal upscaling controlnets at least to me leaves texture changed to be different preserving structure same here with rock texture same here with the bricks same with water leaves again oxidize super micro details got pushed where they werent almost any example of bread texture changing like a clipping mask i think you get what i mean can you get this changes normally yes can you control the image so it dont go to something entirely different and way different than original making those changes thats the question here thats the key of their service you can tell is the same image but better and in normal cases you say bigger sharper but the same thats the difference thats the enhance effect go close to what theyre doing in even with rtx in their short time was obvious and not surprise to me by the way gpu rentingpaying but yes wanted to point the speed talking about my workflow dont expect anything spectacular or unseen ive tried everything loras sliders as detail using sliders training download different upscalers from here creating and ipadapter folder with high resolution images and play with strenghts plus img2img the original one and in some cases dont work most of them by the way injecting noise etc and in the end go back simple workflow combining sag nodes detail pushers and upscales latent upscales to a very very low denoising so the image is the same but with better details still very very far to what theyre doing but at least its a first step and im happy with my learning being said that the workflow will be free to everyone next week and the reason is not ready now for everyone is cause i wanted people close to me patreon members too friends etc to be beta testers so i can see if they cause i have done more than i could here upgrade it see a bit their thoughts etc just for days to see a bit whats there but yes next week free and on civitai",
      "for anime models mature female is a somewhat common token from danbooru captioning terms shrug never used an anime model for the ones i actually named and listed above deliberate and dreamshaper as well as the base it works great for giving actually much older people its relative to whatever it was giving you for that prompt before but ive literally never once failed to add mature and get at least a year older looking person than whatever i had prior if not years older which is usually too much",
      "thank you i was using lower quality only to see if the prompt was working was hoping to go to a higher quality as the next step i was also trying more descriptive prompts that didnt yield results so i thought i should start back with a basic prompt all this said thanks for your suggestion i am going to try this one",
      "not entirely sure about this flux trains incredibly quickly for the results you get but in my testing it does seem to require around triple the training steps of sdxl and each training step is quite a bit slower"

      "i think we need to emphasize the there are certainly categories of photography where a dslr will shine a lot more yeah maybe though ive always found the technical stuff quite easy to learn and i struggle more with composition and working with people ive met plenty people with great gear that produce uninspiring photos some days im one of them there was definitely a time when the primary hurdle to becoming a good photographer was mastering the gear film and maybe chemistry you could make a decent living cranking out routine portraits or shooting for local newspapers these days the bar for technical competency is pretty much gone and someone who takes great photos with a smartphone will almost certainly with comparatively little training be able to take even better ones with a dslr and really who downvoted my original post",
      "i had a imac with 24gb ram and 2tb hdd i replaced it with a macbook pro with m1 pro chip 16gb ram and 1tb ssd even with less memory performance is about the same as the imac was i wish i had gone for the 32gb model though youll need an external monitor if you go the macbook route for i could get a refurbished m2 mini with gb ram and a tb ssd for you can get a new m2 mini with 24gb ram and a 1tb ssd this is what i would do unless you think 1tb isnt enough the 24gb option did not exist with the m1 models at the time i bought my macbook otherwise thats what i would have chosen apple charges an extra to go up to 2tb you can get a 10tb external hdd for half that price would the extra cp in the studio be useful it would be most noticeable when exporting pictures the extra ports compared to the mini are probably more useful than that extra processing power",
      "hi and thank you for taking the time to reply so thoughtfully and at length im right with you on manual focusing and especially on filters and safety which you had no way of knowing so im grateful for your taking care just in case your experience regarding image quality and diffraction at f with the tc is exactly what i was hoping to learn thanks if im one stop or one tc power away from visible diffraction ill take it that im okay but just inside the boundary of okay what remains for me to determine is how much of my available magnifying power i actually want to use the effective 1050mm with the 500mm crop factor tc will give me a sunmoon that occupy about percent of the frame horizontally thanks to jubier i know my max exposure time wo tracking may be as short as sec to avoid motion blur per espenak at iso and f thats good for corona out to one solar radius without the tc at an effective 750mm and all else above the same looking at a smaller apparent disc jubier gives me seconds max exposure and that gives me corona out to somewhere between and solar radii according to espenak so do i want lots of groovy corona or max closeup on bailys beads etc do i have the guts to try mounting or demounting the tc during the of totality ill have at my location or will i remain locked in if i simply leave the tc on and back the zoom out i guess well see if it isnt cloudy in austin thanks again for being so responsive and thoughful",
      "thats a good thought it looks to me like it could be fixed pattern noise but that would run counter to a fast shutter unless the iso went up to compensate",
      "there a quite a few model sites that have many models that are happy to work nude if you pay their rates just search for sites like whatever ones you use you can also post a casting making it clear that youre looking for experience shooting nude models many models are lovely and happy to work with beginners and even advise on posing and positioning",
      "i think the main takeaway from your post is that we should definitely be looking at canon over anything else well im a canonshooter so take that with a grain of salt most shooters think their own brand of camera is superior but if you want a lowcost recentmodel camera canon might make that easier to find that doesnt necessarily mean its a better choice sony might be worth it simply to avoid mount system switchover hassle in the future if we wanted to invest in a model released years ago how much would we need to increase the budget by and what model numbers should we be on the look out for this is just me but these types of camera systems are very expensive no matter which way you slice it because the lenses are interchangeable and that means multiple lenses the lenses are the main expense because if you stick with a mount system those stay with you through the camera body upgrades so getting a year old entrylevel camera so you can afford lenses actually isnt a bad idea particularly if you want to control costs im making an assumption here but if canon has a major share in the market that a lot of the third party lenses with be compatible with any of these older cameras or have some way to adapt them to fit the camera body yes you can adapt canons own and 3rdparty efefs mount dslr lenses to the newer eos r mirrorless mount if needed its just that getting an r mount body at this time is at least and a lens adapter will probably be another then theres the lens being an older optical design and possibly bulkier than a mirrorless design might so for the budget you were looking at sticking with dslr until a newe advanced camera is needed is one option these older cameras all use the ef mount yes efefs the ef lenses are for full frame bodies with larger sensors the efs lenses are for crop bodies with smaller apscsized sensors the size of the sensor also affects the price of the camera while crop bodies can come new in the range full frame bodies are generally in the range while new but a crop body can use both ef and efs lenses the main distinction between the two types of lenses is how big a sensor the image circle the lens projects can cover an ef lens can cover both sizes an efs lens can only cover a crop sensor the website im reading also says canon has an efs mount would these lenses work with the older models of camera or are they for the more recent ones only the ef and efs lenses are for the older dslrs the rf and rfs lenses are for the newcurrent mirrorless the efm i know are for the older eos m mirrorless system which most of us predict is going to be discontinued now that the r50 seems to be a replacement for the m50 ii regarding lense brands is it better to go with canon ones or a third party such as sigma is there such a thing as a better lense yes but sometimes it can be overkill particularly on a budget whats better and whats sufficient may be two different things 3rd party lenses can be great they can be worse but far less expensive or they can fill a hole in the canon oem lineup eg the sigma dc 30mm f has no equivalent efs counterpart so theres no clearcut definitive answer of whats going to be the best fit for your daughters use pattern but i would say for a dslr an kit lens is not a bad way to start though its thoroughly denigated on most online discussions of lenses its cheap its versatile and its an easy way to build up lens experience to figure out what your next lens should be the typical training wheels triple as i call it would be an efs an efs is stm and the ef 50mm f stm regarding mpb and their listings how important is it to take note of the shutter count figure listed underneath each camera advertisement is there a need to select the camera with the lowest figure or does it not really matter does a higher figure indicate something failure of the shutter apart from the previous owner used the camera a lot its just a usage figure think of it like mileage on a used car most dslr camera shutterbox mechanisms are rated for actuations some survive multiples of that before needing a replacement some fail before but roughly speaking if the number is much higher than year that would indicate heavy usage probably professional just as with car mileage",
      "i could imagine theoretically if you pushed the image stops the z6 having a slight amount of some sort of pattern noise that a full frame dslr wouldnt have because essentially being in live view all the time will build up a little more heat in the sensor that leads to slightly noisier shadows the d7500 is apsc though and id be very surprised if it is cleaner in the shadows than the z6 and this able to be pushed more or maybe depending on how the raw is demosaiced and processed there are artifacts from the z6s strips of pixels dedicated to onsensor phase detect i havent seen or heard of this actually happening but there are pixels masked off to be used for the autofocus",
      "i have a pc i built as a nas recently upgraded it to 4x8tb drives in raid this gives me 24tb of storage as you lose one hdd to parity data but means a hdd can fail without data being lost this hot copies to an external 22tb drive overnight and does a full sync end of the week so i have a local recovery for any data i may accidentally delete within a week the 2tb smaller is just they didnt do a 24tb drive at a reasonable price figure by the time i get to needing the capacity one will be available to swap out to everything is then backed up to a cloud storage service backblaze which is ridiculously cheap for unlimited data backups and can order a drive with all the data on them in absolute worse case i need to recover everything and quickly rather than waiting for however long it takes to download the 12tb i have with them currently the service also has a year of file versioning to help against bit rot if a file is corrupted i have a year with which to notice and grab a replacement from the cloud they have unlimited versioning but with the amount of data im storing its a bit cost prohibitive to me all my photography is also sent to amazon photos unlimited storage tier on my uk account limited on my aus account so your location may vary which i view as a free extra precaution given im already paying for prime for other reasons id like to upgrade to a better file system like btrfs or zfs which will help prevent detect bit rot at the system level and be a tad more robust than the ntfs i currently use but the system is a windows box to make it easy for my partner to also use where needed and going linux to get these benefits has other knock on complications badgering them in to windows has an air of unreliability not something im comfortable risking on a storage system so currently thats my only risk which is a low enough probability to not be a massive concern edit just to add this is for storage desktops for editing has a large enough drive to take the data from the memory cards for working locally on before being pushed to the nas pc for storage memory cards are large enough that i dont need to clear them until work is delivered plus i rotate cards between jobs and i shoot to two cards so theres always multiple copies until items are delivered where the cards are then cleared and the desktop will be cleared out leaving just the nas and the cloud",
      "im not sure which model it is exactly because its really old and very scratched up but i need a camera with better quality and more detail the one i have now barely functions anymore and its was very cheap so i dont really know anything about high quality cameras",
      "downside is the subject is usually close to the camera try zoom slider",
      "thats exactly what i need i just need to find a model of flash that has that functionality otherwise im stuck using my af lens with my flash or investing in an af prime lens like i mentioned in another comment it makes sense to me that you would include an af zoom kit lens with an af flash in the standard packaging from the factory",
      "subjects are uncomfortable in front of the camera dont want to get their picture taken in the first place this is true for most people whether it be corporate headshots family portraits or bridals before a wedding the company has to invest a notsmall chunk of working hours this is true for one employee who may be helping to coordinate everyone having their picture taken should just be a few minutes each if this is done on site clients dont like their pictures and want a reshoot i shoot tethered to a laptop i shoot or so shots then i let you see your hair smile tilt of your head that necklace you werent sure about we talk about it for a few seconds make adjustments then shoot more you pick your shot before you walk away there are no reshoots locations are not optimal for lighting this can be true i have one client who only wants shallow depth of field shots with the employees work area blurred in the background the lighting is often bad this is why i bring lights and modifiers also corporate headshots look always more or less the same clean professional confident strong retouch not really much personality mine are more dirty and natural always in the work environment or outside and never the traditional light shot on a headshot background with deep fake methods like latent diffusion you could train a model for a subject in a short period of time using like selfies and then create all the corporate headshots you need you could also adjust posture facial expressions good smile also for camera shy people clothes etc a good photographer is already doing this my main point is that the client has effectively work except getting selfies of each subject and then the corporate headshots can be taken some people may switch to this many will not",
      "i recommend the ipad air model with the m1 chip and 256gb storage i spent so long debating if i should go with a higher or lower end ipad but the air is a pretty strong balance biggest thing is it supports the apple pencil at the best value price point the cheaper normal ipad are okay if youre really sticking to a lower budget but only support the apple pencil the air has a better screen along with the wireless pencil charging the pro gets you a bigger screen and more storage for honestly too much extra money if you dont know that you need the extra screen space you probably dont need it yet and youre better off using either a cloud or external storage solution if you really need 1tb of storage 256gb is plenty of working space and i would always recommend backups of your art on a different storage space anyways you wouldnt want everything to suddenly disappear especially since the ipad probably wont stay in a single safe spot at all times",
      "its worth noting that something to look out for at least with illustrator is that many even basic things that should be handled by nonrasterised methods like filters end up just being stored as rasterised images when you export as an svg as well as internally hence why ai filesizes can often balloon in size so exporting what you think is a vector as an svg can actually end up bigger than just exporting it as a flat rasterised image since then there isnt dozens of embedded images for each of the effects and since the effects are just rasterised images anyway doing it as a flat image avoids the problem of having weird scaling issues",
      "i think u r replying to the wrong guy its not cause they are shitty its how the client potentially going to use the raw files and associate them to u which could damage ur reputation do u want to go through all the legal shenanigans if both u and ur client got the raws and photo data can be manipulated its software afterall edit i dont knw if u r the client or photographer so just take the reasoning from photographer perspective",
      "those are all different vintage film simulation effects also soft focus and star filter i dont know of any particular ones offhand but search for terms like that and you should be able to find a bunch of apps",
      "breeze downloader pro or photo mechanic allows ingesting using tokens so you can use metadata or user supplied data in your path and filename when pulling in photos for example i have pm to ingest to imagesyeardatejobclient so everything taken on the same day for the same job gets put together then the filenames get the same treatment using the exif shoottime job camera and a numeric sequence i always include the camera like griii a7m4 5dm4 etc in the filename in case something happens like you mentioned like to adjust for timezone makes it easy to select and redo with whatever changes i need to make",
